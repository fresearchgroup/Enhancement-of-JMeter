<section name="Issue tracker">
<p>
JMeter uses Bugzilla for issue tracking, i.e. for reporting bugs and requesting enhancements.
</p>
<p>
Before creating a new issue, please check whether the issue has already been reported by searching Bugzilla.
It's also worth checking first on the JMeter user mailing list; others may already have a solution. 
</p>

<section name="Raising an Issue">
<p>
First check that the issue has not already been reported. 
If reporting a bug, are you sure it really is a bug in JMeter, not just a misunderstanding of how JMeter works?
</p>
<p>
If you have not already done so, you need to register an account first, using the "New Account" link at the top of the
main Bugzilla page: <a href="https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/">https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/</a>.
</p>
<p>
Make sure you read and understand the information on the account creation page before signing up.
</p>
<p>
Once logged in, click "File a bug" and select JMeter from the list.
</p>
</section>
<section name="Required Information">
<p>
Please make sure you provide sufficient information for others to be able to make use of the report effectively.
Use the checklist below to guide you.
</p>
<ul>
<li>JMeter version</li>
<li>Java version (output from java -version)</li>
<li>OS version</li>
<li>jmeter.log file (unlikely to contain sensitive information, but check before uploading)</li>
<li>JMX file if relevant (redact any sensitive information first), providing a simplified Test Plan (using DEBUG sampler) will ensure BUG is fixed much more rapidely than without it</li>
<li>JTL file if relevant (may need to redact sensitive information)</li>
<li>For a suspected bug, describe what you did, what happened, and how this differs from what you expected to happen.
Does it happen every time?. 
</li>
<li>Add yourself in CC List to be notified when JMeter Team requires more information (in this case bug will be marked as NEEDINFO)</li>
<li>Select accurately the IMPORTANCE level, ENHANCEMENT means it's not a BUG while others mean it's a BUG</li>
<li>If you are providing a patch to fix a bug, please ensure it is in unified diff format.
If using Eclipse, please set the patch root to "Project", not the default "Workspace" which is harder to apply.</li>
<li>New source files can be provided as is; please ensure they have the standard Apache License header (as per other JMeter files).
Please do not use @author tags (credit will be given in the changes file).
</li>
<li>In the case of patches for new features, please also provide documentation patches if at all possible. 
Components are documented in xdocs/usermanual/component_reference.xml.</li>
