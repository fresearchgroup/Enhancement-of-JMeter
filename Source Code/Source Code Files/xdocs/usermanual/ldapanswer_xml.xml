	<title>User's Manual: LDAP answer XML description</title>

<section name="description of the ldapanswer XML definition" anchor="ldapans_xml">
<p>
	The extended LDAP sampler was built to support testing for very complex testpurposes.
	It was aimed at supporting the LDAP operations as close as possible.
	As the results are not passed back in a user-readable form, I invented my own xml definition to 
	construct an answer in xml encoding, so the results may be parsed with regextracter or alike functions.
</p>

<subsection name="1 Global overview" anchor="overview">
<p>
	The global structure is as follows:<br/>
<!--
<ol>
<li>
	&lt;ldapanswer&gt; and &lt;ldapanswer/&gt; are the begin and endtags which are used to define the beginning ands end of the answer.

</li>
<li>
	each ldapanswer contains 4 sections, an "operation" section (enclosed by 
	&lt;operation&gt; tags) a respons code section (enclosed by &lt;responsecode&gt; tags), a 
	response message (enclosed by &lt;responsemessage&gt; tags and (only with a search 
	request) a searchresult section (enclosed with &ltsearchresult&gt tags>
