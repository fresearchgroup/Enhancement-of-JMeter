 <note>
 Several test elements use JMeter properties to control their behaviour.
 These properties are normally resolved when the class is loaded.
 This generally occurs before the test plan starts, so it's not possible to change the settings by using the __setProperty() function.

This controller lets you send an FTP "retrieve file" or "upload file" request to an FTP server.
If you are going to send multiple requests to the same FTP server, consider
using a <complink name="FTP Request Defaults"/> Configuration
Element so you do not have to enter the same information for each FTP Request Generative
Controller. When downloading a file, it can be stored on disk (Local File) or in the Response Data, or both.
<p>
Latency is set to the time it takes to login (versions of JMeter after 2.3.1).

<description>
        <p>This sampler lets you send an HTTP/HTTPS request to a web server.  It
        also lets you control whether or not JMeter parses HTML files for images and
        other embedded resources and sends HTTP requests to retrieve them.
        The following types of embedded resource are retrieved:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>images</li>
        <li>applets</li>
        <li>stylesheets</li>
        <li>external scripts</li>
        <li>frames, iframes</li>
        <li>background images (body, table, TD, TR)</li>
        <li>background sound</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        The default parser is htmlparser.
        This can be changed by using the property "htmlparser.classname" - see jmeter.properties for details.
        </p>
        <p>If you are going to send multiple requests to the same web server, consider
        using an <complink name="HTTP Request Defaults"/>
        Configuration Element so you do not have to enter the same information for each
        HTTP Request.</p>

        <p>Or, instead of manually adding HTTP Requests, you may want to use
        JMeter's <complink name="HTTP Proxy Server"/> to create
        them.  This can save you time if you have a lot of HTTP requests or requests with many
        parameters.</p>

        <p><b>There are two different screens for defining the samplers:</b>
        <ul>
        <li>AJP/1.3 Sampler - uses the Tomcat mod_jk protocol (allows testing of Tomcat in AJP mode without needing Apache httpd)
        The AJP Sampler does not support multiple file upload; only the first file will be used.
        </li>
        <li>HTTP Request - this has an implementation drop-down box, which selects the HTTP protocol implementation to be used:</li>
        <ul>
        <li>Java - uses the HTTP implementation provided by the JVM. 
        This has some limitations in comparison with the HttpClient implementations - see below.</li>
        <li>HTTPClient3.1 - uses Apache Commons HttpClient 3.1. 
        This is no longer being developed, and support for this may be dropped in a future JMeter release.</li>
        <li>HTTPClient4 - uses Apache HttpComponents HttpClient 4.x.</li>
        <li>Blank Value - does not set implementationon HTTP Samplers, so relies on HTTP Request Defaults if present or on jmeter.httpsampler property defined in jmeter.properties</li>
        </ul>
        </ul>
         </p>
         <p>The Java HTTP implementation has some limitations:</p>
         <ul>
         <li>There is no control over how connections are re-used. 
         When a connection is released by JMeter, it may or may not be re-used by the same thread.</li>
         <li>The API is best suited to single-threaded usage - various settings (e.g. proxy) 
         are defined via system properties, and therefore apply to all connections.</li>
         <li>There is a bug in the handling of HTTPS via a Proxy (the CONNECT is not handled correctly).
         See Java bugs 6226610 and 6208335.
         </li>
         <li>It does not support virtual hosts.</li>
         </ul>
         <p>Note: the FILE protocol is intended for testing puposes only. 
         It is handled by the same code regardless of which HTTP Sampler is used.</p>
        <p>If the request requires server or proxy login authorization (i.e. where a browser would create a pop-up dialog box),
         you will also have to add an <complink name="HTTP Authorization Manager"/> Configuration Element.
         For normal logins (i.e. where the user enters login information in a form), you will need to work out what the form submit button does,
         and create an HTTP request with the appropriate method (usually POST) 
         and the appropriate parameters from the form definition. 
         If the page uses HTTP, you can use the JMeter Proxy to capture the login sequence.
        </p>
        <p>
        In versions of JMeter up to 2.2, only a single SSL context was used for all threads and samplers.
        This did not generate the proper load for multiple users.
        A separate SSL context is now used for each thread.
        To revert to the original behaviour, set the JMeter property:
<pre>
https.sessioncontext.shared=true
</pre>
        By default, the SSL context is retained for the duration of the test.
        In versions of JMeter from 2.5.1, the SSL session can be optionally reset for each test iteration.
        To enable this, set the JMeter property:
<pre>
https.use.cached.ssl.context=false
</pre>
        Note: this does not apply to the Java HTTP implementation.
        </p>
        <p>
        JMeter defaults to the SSL protocol level TLS.
        If the server needs a different level, e.g. SSLv3, change the JMeter property, for example:
<pre>
https.default.protocol=SSLv3
</pre> 
        </p>
        <p>
        JMeter also allows one to enable additional protocols, by changing the property <tt>https.socket.protocols</tt>.
        </p>
        <p>If the request uses cookies, then you will also need an
        <complink name="HTTP Cookie Manager"/>.  You can
        add either of these elements to the Thread Group or the HTTP Request.  If you have
        more than one HTTP Request that needs authorizations or cookies, then add the
        elements to the Thread Group.  That way, all HTTP Request controllers will share the
        same Authorization Manager and Cookie Manager elements.</p>

        <p>If the request uses a technique called "URL Rewriting" to maintain sessions,
        then see section
        <a href="build-adv-web-test-plan.html#session_url_rewriting">6.1 Handling User Sessions With URL Rewriting</a>
        for additional configuration steps.</p>

            Domain name or IP address of the web server. e.g. www.example.com. [Do not include the http:// prefix.]
            Note: in JMeter 2.5 (and later) if the "Host" header is defined in a Header Manager, then this will be used
            as the virtual host name.
        </property>
        <property name="Port" required="No">Port the web server is listening to. Default: 80</property>

        <property name="Password" required="No">(Optional) password for proxy server. (N.B. this is stored unencrypted in the test plan)</property>
        <property name="Implementation" required="No">Java, HttpClient3.1, HttpClient4. 
        If not specified (and not defined by HTTP Request Defaults), the default depends on the value of the JMeter property
        <code>jmeter.httpsampler</code>, failing that, the Java implementation is used.</property>
        <property name="Protocol" required="No">HTTP, HTTPS or FILE. Default: HTTP</property>
        <property name="Method" required="Yes">GET, POST, HEAD, TRACE, OPTIONS, PUT, DELETE, PATCH (not supported for JAVA implementation)</property>
        <property name="Content Encoding" required="No">
        Content encoding to be used (for POST, PUT, PATCH and FILE). 
        This the the character encoding to be used, and is not related to the Content-Encoding HTTP header.
        </property>
		<property name="Redirect Automatically" required="No">
		Sets the underlying http protocol handler to automatically follow redirects,
		so they are not seen by JMeter, and thus will not appear as samples.
		Should only be used for GET and HEAD requests.
		The HttpClient sampler will reject attempts to use it for POST or PUT.
		<b>Warning: see below for information on cookie and header handling.</b>
        </property>
		<property name="Follow Redirects" required="No">
		This only has any effect if "Redirect Automatically" is not enabled.
		If set, the JMeter sampler will check if the response is a redirect and follow it if so.
		The initial redirect and further responses will appear as additional samples.
        The URL and data fields of the parent sample will be taken from the final (non-redirected)
        sample, but the parent byte count and elapsed time include all samples.
        The latency is taken from the initial response (versions of JMeter after 2.3.4 - previously it was zero).
		Note that the HttpClient sampler may log the following message:<br/>
		"Redirect requested but followRedirects is disabled"<br/>
		This can be ignored.
        <br/>
        In versions after 2.3.4, JMeter will collapse paths of the form '/../segment' in
        both absolute and relative redirect URLs. For example http://host/one/../two => http://host/two.
        If necessary, this behaviour can be suppressed by setting the JMeter property
        <code>httpsampler.redirect.removeslashdotdot=false</code>
		</property>
		<property name="Use KeepAlive" required="No">JMeter sets the Connection: keep-alive header. This does not work properly with the default HTTP implementation, as connection re-use is not under user-control. 
                  It does work with the Apache HttpComponents HttpClient implementations.</property>
        <property name="Use multipart/form-data for HTTP POST" required="No">
        Use a multipart/form-data or application/x-www-form-urlencoded post request
        </property>
        <property name="Browser-compatible headers" required="No">
        When using multipart/form-data, this suppresses the Content-Type and 
        Content-Transfer-Encoding headers; only the Content-Disposition header is sent.
        </property>
        <property name="Path" required="Yes">The path to resource (for example, /servlets/myServlet). If the
resource requires query string parameters, add them below in the
"Send Parameters With the Request" section.
<b>
As a special case, if the path starts with "http://" or "https://" then this is used as the full URL.
</b>
In this case, the server, port and protocol are ignored; parameters are also ignored for GET and DELETE methods.
</property>
        <property name="Send Parameters With the Request" required="No">The query string will
        be generated from the list of parameters you provide.  Each parameter has a <i>name</i> and
        <i>value</i>, the options to encode the parameter, and an option to include or exclude an equals sign (some applications
        don't expect an equals when the value is the empty string).  The query string will be generated in the correct fashion, depending on
        the choice of "Method" you made (ie if you chose GET or DELETE, the query string will be
        appended to the URL, if POST or PUT, then it will be sent separately).  Also, if you are
        sending a file using a multipart form, the query string will be created using the
        multipart form specifications.
        <b>See below for some further information on parameter handling.</b>
        <p>
        Additionally, you can specify whether each parameter should be URL encoded.  If you are not sure what this
        means, it is probably best to select it.  If your values contain characters such as the following then encoding is usually required.:
        <ul>
            <li>ASCII Control Chars</li>
            <li>Non-ASCII characters</li>
            <li>Reserved characters:URLs use some characters for special use in defining their syntax. When these characters are not used in their special role inside a URL, they need to be encoded, example : '$', '&amp;', '+', ',' , '/', ':', ';', '=', '?', '@'</li>
            <li>Unsafe characters: Some characters present the possibility of being misunderstood within URLs for various reasons. These characters should also always be encoded, example : ' ', '&lt;', '&gt;', '#', '%', ...</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        </property>
        <property name="File Path:" required="No">Name of the file to send.  If left blank, JMeter
        does not send a file, if filled in, JMeter automatically sends the request as
        a multipart form request.
        <p>
        If it is a POST or PUT or PATCH request and there is a single file whose 'Parameter name' attribute (below) is omitted, 
        then the file is sent as the entire body
        of the request, i.e. no wrappers are added. This allows arbitrary bodies to be sent. This functionality is present for POST requests
        after version 2.2, and also for PUT requests after version 2.3.
        <b>See below for some further information on parameter handling.</b>
        </p>
        </property>
        <property name="Parameter name:" required="No">Value of the "name" web request parameter.</property>
        <property name="MIME Type" required="No">MIME type (for example, text/plain).
        If it is a POST or PUT or PATCH request and either the 'name' atribute (below) are omitted or the request body is
        constructed from parameter values only, then the value of this field is used as the value of the
        content-type request header.
        </property>
        <property name="Retrieve All Embedded Resources from HTML Files" required="No">Tell JMeter to parse the HTML file
and send HTTP/HTTPS requests for all images, Java applets, JavaScript files, CSSs, etc. referenced in the file.
        See below for more details.
        </property>
        <property name="Use as monitor" required="No">For use with the <complink name="Monitor Results"/> listener.</property>
       <property name="Save response as MD5 hash?" required="No">
       If this is selected, then the response is not stored in the sample result.
       Instead, the 32 character MD5 hash of the data is calculated and stored instead.
       This is intended for testing large amounts of data.
       </property>
        <property name="Embedded URLs must match:" required="No">
        If present, this must be a regular expression that is used to match against any embedded URLs found.
        So if you only want to download embedded resources from http://example.com/, use the expression:
        http://example\.com/.*
        </property>
        <property name="Use concurrent pool" required="No">Use a pool of concurrent connections to get embedded resources.</property>
        <property name="Size" required="No">Pool size for concurrent connections used to get embedded resources.</property>
        <property name="Source IP address:" required="No">
        [Only for HTTP Request HTTPClient] 
        Override the default local IP address for this sample.
        The JMeter host must have multiple IP addresses (i.e. IP aliases or network interfaces). 
        If the property <b>httpclient.localaddress</b> is defined, that is used for all HttpClient requests.
        </property>
</properties>
<p>
<b>N.B.</b> when using Automatic Redirection, cookies are only sent for the initial URL.
This can cause unexpected behaviour for web-sites that redirect to a local server.
E.g. if www.example.com redirects to www.example.co.uk.
In this case the server will probably return cookies for both URLs, but JMeter will only see the cookies for the last
host, i.e. www.example.co.uk. If the next request in the test plan uses www.example.com, 
rather than www.example.co.uk, it will not get the correct cookies.
Likewise, Headers are sent for the initial request, and won't be sent for the redirect.
This is generally only a problem for manually created test plans,
as a test plan created using a recorder would continue from the redirected URL.
</p>
<p>
<b>Parameter Handling:</b><br></br>
For the POST and PUT method, if there is no file to send, and the name(s) of the parameter(s) are omitted,
then the body is created by concatenating all the value(s) of the parameters.
Note that the values are concatenated without adding any end-of-line characters.
These can be added by using the __char() function in the value fields.
This allows arbitrary bodies to be sent.
The values are encoded if the encoding flag is set (versions of JMeter after 2.3).
See also the MIME Type above how you can control the content-type request header that is sent.
<br></br>
For other methods, if the name of the parameter is missing,
then the parameter is ignored. This allows the use of optional parameters defined by variables.
(versions of JMeter after 2.3)
</p>
<br/>
<p>Since JMeter 2.6, you have the option to switch to Post Body when a request has only unnamed parameters
(or no parameters at all).
This option is useful in the following cases (amongst others):
<ul>
<li>GWT RPC HTTP Request</li>
<li>JSON REST HTTP Request</li>
<li>XML REST HTTP Request</li>
<li>SOAP HTTP Request</li>
</ul>
Note that once you leave the Tree node, you cannot switch back to the parameter tab unless you clear the Post Body tab of data.
</p>
<p>
In Post Body mode, each line will be sent with CRLF appended, apart from the last line.
To send a CRLF after the last line of data, just ensure that there is an empty line following it.
(This cannot be seen, except by noting whether the cursor can be placed on the subsequent line.)
</p>

<figure width="905" height="423" image="http-request-raw-body.png">Figure 3 - HTTP Request using RAW Post body</figure>

<p>
<b>Method Handling:</b><br></br>
The POST, PUT and PATCH request methods work similarly, except that the PUT and PATCH methods do not support multipart requests
or file upload.
The PUT and PATCH method body must be provided as one of the following:
<ul>
<li>define the body as a file with empty Parameter name field; in which case the MIME Type is used as the Content-Type</li>
<li>define the body as parameter value(s) with no name</li>
<li>use the Post Body tab</li>
</ul>
If you define any parameters with a name in either the sampler or Http
defaults then nothing is sent.
PUT and PATCH require a Content-Type. 
If not using a file, attach a Header Manager to the sampler and define the Content-Type there.
The GET and DELETE request methods work similarly to each other.
</p>
<p>Upto and including JMeter 2.1.1, only responses with the content-type "text/html" were scanned for
embedded resources. Other content-types were assumed to be something other than HTML.
JMeter 2.1.2 introduces the a new property <b>HTTPResponse.parsers</b>, which is a list of parser ids,
 e.g. <b>htmlParser</b> and <b>wmlParser</b>. For each id found, JMeter checks two further properties:</p>
 <ul>
 <li>id.types - a list of content types</li>
 <li>id.className - the parser to be used to extract the embedded resources</li>
 </ul>
 <p>See jmeter.properties file for the details of the settings. 
 If the HTTPResponse.parser property is not set, JMeter reverts to the previous behaviour,
 i.e. only text/html responses will be scanned</p>
<b>Emulating slow connections (HttpClient only):</b><br></br>
The HttpClient version of the sampler supports emulation of slow connections; see the following entries in jmeter.properties:
<pre>
# Define characters per second > 0 to emulate slow connections
#httpclient.socket.http.cps=0
#httpclient.socket.https.cps=0
</pre>
<p><b>Response size calculation</b><br></br>
Optional properties to allow change the method to get response size:<br></br>
<ul><li>Gets the real network size in bytes for the body response
<pre>sampleresult.getbytes.body_real_size=true</pre></li>
<li>Add HTTP headers to full response size
<pre>sampleresult.getbytes.headers_size=true</pre></li></ul>

<note>
The Java and HttpClient3 inplementations do not include transport overhead such as
chunk headers in the response body size.<br></br>
The HttpClient4 implementation does include the overhead in the response body size,
so the value may be greater than the number of bytes in the response content.
</note>

<note>Versions of JMeter before 2.5 returns only data response size (uncompressed if request uses gzip/defate mode).
<br></br>To return to settings before version 2.5, set the two properties to false.</note>
</p>
<p>
<b>Retry handling</b><br></br>
In version 2.5 of JMeter, the HttpClient4 and Commons HttpClient 3.1 samplers used the default retry count, which was 3.
In later versions, the retry count has been set to 1, which is what the Java implementation appears to do.
The retry count can be overridden by setting the relevant JMeter property, for example:
<pre>
httpclient4.retrycount=3
httpclient3.retrycount=3
</pre>

<description><p>This sampler lets you send an JDBC Request (an SQL query) to a database.</p>
<p>Before using this you need to set up a
<complink name="JDBC Connection Configuration"/> Configuration element
</p>
<p>
If the Variable Names list is provided, then for each row returned by a Select statement, the variables are set up
with the value of the corresponding column (if a variable name is provided), and the count of rows is also set up.
For example, if the Select statement returns 2 rows of 3 columns, and the variable list is <code>A,,C</code>,
then the following variables will be set up:
<pre>
A_#=2 (number of rows)
A_1=column 1, row 1
A_2=column 1, row 2
C_#=2 (number of rows)
C_1=column 3, row 1
C_2=column 3, row 2
</pre>
If the Select statement returns zero rows, then the A_# and C_# variables would be set to 0, and no other variables would be set.
</p>
<p>
Old variables are cleared if necessary - e.g. if the first select retrieves 6 rows and a second select returns only 3 rows,
the additional variables for rows 4, 5 and 6 will be removed.
</p>
<p>
<b>Note:</b> The latency time is set from the time it took to acquire a connection.

        There is generally no need to use { and } to enclose Callable statements;
        however they mey be used if the database uses a non-standard syntax.
        [The JDBC driver automatically converts the statement if necessary when it is enclosed in {}].
        For example:

<description><p>This sampler lets you control a java class that implements the
<b><code>org.apache.jmeter.protocol.java.sampler.JavaSamplerClient</code></b> interface.
By writing your own implementation of this interface,
you can use JMeter to harness multiple threads, input parameter control, and
data collection.</p>
<p>The pull-down menu provides the list of all such implementations found by
JMeter in its classpath.  The parameters can then be specified in the
table below - as defined by your implementation.  Two simple examples (JavaTest and SleepTest) are provided.
</p>
<p>
The JavaTest example sampler can be useful for checking test plans, because it allows one to set
values in almost all the fields. These can then be used by Assertions, etc.
The fields allow variables to be used, so the values of these can readily be seen.
</p>
</description>

<note>Since JMeter 2.8, if the method teardownTest is not overriden by a subclass of AbstractJavaSamplerClient, its teardownTest method will not be called.
This reduces JMeter memory requirements.
This will not have any impact on existing Test plans.

<description><p>This sampler lets you send a SOAP request to a webservice.  It can also be
used to send XML-RPC over HTTP.  It creates an HTTP POST request, with the specified XML as the
POST content. 
To change the "Content-type" from the default of "text/xml", use a HeaderManager. 
Note that the sampler will use all the headers from the HeaderManager.
If a SOAP action is specified, that will override any SOAPaction in the HeaderManager.
The primary difference between the soap sampler and
webservice sampler, is the soap sampler uses raw post and does not require conformance to
SOAP 1.1.</p>
<note>For versions of JMeter later than 2.2, the sampler no longer uses chunked encoding by default.<br/>
For screen input, it now always uses the size of the data.<br/>
File input uses the file length as determined by Java.<br/>
On some OSes this may not work for all files, in which case add a child Header Manager
with Content-Length set to the actual length of the file.<br/>
Or set Content-Length to -1 to force chunked encoding.

<component name="WebService(SOAP) Request (DEPRECATED)" useinstead="HTTP_Request" index="&sect-num;.1.6" width="943" height="648" screenshot="webservice_sampler.png">
<description><p>This sampler has been tested with IIS Webservice running .NET 1.0 and .NET 1.1.
 It has been tested with SUN JWSDP, IBM webservices, Axis and gSoap toolkit for C/C++.
 The sampler uses Apache SOAP driver to serialize the message and set the header
 with the correct SOAPAction. Right now the sampler doesn't support automatic WSDL
 handling, since Apache SOAP currently does not provide support for it. Both IBM
 and SUN provide WSDL drivers. There are 3 options for the post data: text area,
 external file, or directory. If you want the sampler to randomly select a message,
 use the directory. Otherwise, use the text area or a file. The if either the
 file or path are set, it will not use the message in the text area. If you need
 to test a soap service that uses different encoding, use the file or path. If you
 paste the message in to text area, it will not retain the encoding and will result
 in errors. Save your message to a file with the proper encoding, and the sampler
 will read it as java.io.FileInputStream.</p>
 <p>An important note on the sampler is it will automatically use the proxy host
 and port passed to JMeter from command line, if those fields in the sampler are
 left blank. If a sampler has values in the proxy host and port text field, it
 will use the ones provided by the user. This behavior may not be what users
 expect.</p>
 <p>By default, the webservice sampler sets SOAPHTTPConnection.setMaintainSession
 (true). If you need to maintain the session, add a blank Header Manager. The
 sampler uses the Header Manager to store the SOAPHTTPConnection object, since
 the version of apache soap does not provide a easy way to get and set the cookies.</p>
 <p><b>Note:</b> If you are using CSVDataSet, do not check "Memory Cache". If memory
 cache is checked, it will not iterate to the next value. That means all the requests
 will use the first value.</p>
 <p>Make sure you use &amp;lt;soap:Envelope rather than &amp;lt;Envelope. For example:</p>
 <pre>
&amp;lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
&amp;lt;soap:Envelope 
xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema" 
xmlns:soap="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/">
&amp;lt;soap:Body>
&amp;lt;foo xmlns="http://clients-xlmns"/>
&amp;lt;/soap:Body>
&amp;lt;/soap:Envelope>
</pre>
<note>The SOAP library that is used does not support SOAP 1.2, only SOAP 1.1. 
Also the library does not provide access to the HTTP response code (e.g. 200) or message (e.g. OK). 
To get round this, versions of JMeter after 2.3.2 check the returned message length.
If this is zero, then the request is marked as failed.

  <p>There are two ways to create test cases for testing an LDAP Server.</p>
  <ol><li>Inbuilt Test cases.</li>
    <li>User defined Test cases.</li></ol>

    <p>There are four test scenarios of testing LDAP. The tests are given below:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Add Test</li>
      <ol><li>Inbuilt test :
        <p>This will add a pre-defined entry in the LDAP Server and calculate
          the execution time. After execution of the test, the created entry will be
          deleted from the LDAP
          Server.</p></li>
          <li>User defined test :
            <p>This will add the entry in the LDAP Server. User has to enter all the
              attributes in the table.The entries are collected from the table to add. The
              execution time is calculated. The created entry will not be deleted after the
              test.</p></li></ol>

              <li>Modify Test</li>
              <ol><li>Inbuilt test :
                <p>This will create a pre-defined entry first, then will modify the
                  created	entry in the LDAP Server.And calculate the execution time. After
                  execution
                  of the test, the created entry will be deleted from the LDAP Server.</p></li>
                  <li>User defined test
                    <p>This will modify the entry in the LDAP Server. User has to enter all the
                      attributes in the table. The entries are collected from the table to modify.
                      The execution time is calculated. The entry will not be deleted from the LDAP
                      Server.</p></li></ol>

                      <li>Search Test</li>
                      <ol><li>Inbuilt test :
                        <p>This will create the entry first, then will search if the attributes
                          are available. It calculates the execution time of the search query. At the
                          end of  the execution,created entry will be deleted from the LDAP Server.</p></li>
                          <li>User defined test
                            <p>This will search the user defined entry(Search filter) in the Search
                              base (again, defined by the user). The entries should be available in the LDAP
                              Server. The execution time is  calculated.</p></li></ol>

                              <li>Delete Test</li>
                              <ol><li>Inbuilt test :
                                <p>This will create a pre-defined entry first, then it will be deleted

<component name="LDAP Extended Request" index="&sect-num;.1.8" width="619" height="371" screenshot="ldapext_request.png">
  <description>This Sampler can send all 8 different LDAP request to an LDAP server. It is an extended version of the LDAP sampler,
  therefore it is harder to configure, but can be made much closer resembling a real LDAP session.
    <p>If you are going to send multiple requests to the same LDAP server, consider
      using an <complink name="LDAP Extended Request Defaults"/>
      Configuration Element so you do not have to enter the same information for each
      LDAP Request.</p> </description>

   <p>There are nine test operations defined. These operations are given below:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><b>Thread bind</b></li>
      <p>Any LDAP request is part of an LDAP session, so the first thing that should be done is starting a session to the LDAP server.
       For starting this session a thread bind is used, which is equal to the LDAP "bind" operation.
       The user is requested to give a username (Distinguished name) and password, 
       which will be used to initiate a session.
       When no password, or the wrong password is specified, an anonymous session is started. Take care,
       omitting the password will not fail this test, a wrong password will. 
       (N.B. this is stored unencrypted in the test plan)</p>
     <properties>
     <property name="Name" required="No">Descriptive name for this sampler that is shown in the tree.</property>
     <property name="Servername" required="Yes">The name (or IP-address) of the LDAP server.</property>
     <property name="Port" required="No">The port number that the LDAP server is listening to. If this is omitted 
     JMeter assumes the LDAP server is listening on the default port(389).</property>
     <property name="DN" required="No">The distinguished name of the base object that will be used for any subsequent operation. 
     It can be used as a starting point for all operations. You cannot start any operation on a higher level than this DN!</property>
     <property name="Username" required="No">Full distinguished name of the user as which you want to bind.</property>
     <property name="Password" required="No">Password for the above user. If omitted it will result in an anonymous bind. 
     If is is incorrect, the sampler will return an error and revert to an anonymous bind. (N.B. this is stored unencrypted in the test plan)</property>
    </properties>
 <br />       
      <li><b>Thread unbind</b></li>
      <p>This is simply the operation to end a session. 
      It is equal to the LDAP "unbind" operation.</p>
     <properties>
     <property name="Name" required="No">Descriptive name for this sampler that is shown in the tree.</property>
    </properties>
     
 <br />       
      <li><b>Single bind/unbind</b></li>
		<p> This is a combination of the LDAP "bind" and "unbind" operations.
		It can be used for an authentication request/password check for any user. It will open an new session, just to
		check the validity of the user/password combination, and end the session again.</p>
    <properties>
     <property name="Name" required="No">Descriptive name for this sampler that is shown in the tree.</property>
      <property name="Username" required="Yes">Full distinguished name of the user as which you want to bind.</property>
     <property name="Password" required="No">Password for the above user. If omitted it will result in an anonymous bind. 
     If is is incorrect, the sampler will return an error. (N.B. this is stored unencrypted in the test plan)</property>
     </properties>
		
 <br />       
      <li><b>Rename entry</b></li>
       <p>This is the LDAP "moddn" operation. It can be used to rename an entry, but 
       also for moving an entry or a complete subtree to a different place in 
       the LDAP tree.  </p>
    <properties>
     <property name="Name" required="No">Descriptive name for this sampler that is shown in the tree.</property>

     </properties>
       
 <br />       
        <li><b>Add test</b></li>
       <p>This is the ldap "add" operation. It can be used to add any kind of 
       object to the LDAP server.  </p>
    <properties>
     <property name="Name" required="No">Descriptive name for this sampler that is shown in the tree.</property>

     <property name="Add test" required="Yes">A list of attributes and their values you want to use for the object.
     If you need to add a multiple value attribute, you need to add the same attribute with their respective

     </properties>
       
 <br />       
      <li><b>Delete test</b></li>
       <p> This is the LDAP "delete" operation, it can be used to delete an 
       object from the LDAP tree </p>
    <properties>
     <property name="Name" required="No">Descriptive name for this sampler that is shown in the tree.</property>
      <property name="Delete" required="Yes">Distinguished name of the object you want to delete, relative to the given DN in the thread bind operation.</property>
      </properties>
       
 <br />       
      <li><b>Search test</b></li>
       <p>This is the LDAP "search" operation, and will be used for defining searches.  </p>
    <properties>
     <property name="Name" required="No">Descriptive name for this sampler that is shown in the tree.</property>
      <property name="Search base" required="No">Distinguished name of the subtree you want your

      <property name="Scope" required="No">Use 0 for baseobject-, 1 for onelevel- and 2 for a subtree search. (Default=0)</property>
      <property name="Size Limit" required="No">Specify the maximum number of results you want back from the server. (default=0, which means no limit.) When the sampler hits the maximum number of results, it will fail with errorcode 4</property>
      <property name="Time Limit" required="No">Specify the maximum amount of (cpu)time (in miliseconds) that the server can spend on your search. Take care, this does not say anything about the responsetime. (default is 0, which means no limit)</property>
      <property name="Attributes" required="No">Specify the attributes you want to have returned, seperated by a semicolon. An empty field will return all attributes</property>
      <property name="Return object" required="No">Whether the object will be returned (true) or not (false). Default=false</property>
      <property name="Dereference aliases" required="No">If true, it will dereference aliases, if false, it will not follow them (default=false)</property>
     </properties>

 <br />       
      <li><b>Modification test</b></li>
       <p>This is the LDAP "modify" operation. It can be used to modify an object. It
       can be used to add, delete or replace values of an attribute. </p>

     the given value will be deleted. If this value is non-existent, the sampler will fail the test.</property>
     </properties>
       
 <br />       
      <li><b>Compare</b></li>
       <p>This is the LDAP "compare" operation. It can be used to compare the value 
       of a given attribute with some already known value. In reality this is mostly 
       used to check whether a given person is a member of some group. In such a case
        you can compare the DN of the user as a given value, with the values in the
         attribute "member" of an object of the type groupOfNames.
         If the compare operation fails, this test fails with errorcode 49.</p>

<component name="Access Log Sampler" index="&sect-num;.1.9"  width="613" height="318" screenshot="accesslogsampler.png">
<center><h2>(Alpha Code)</h2></center>
<description><p>AccessLogSampler was designed to read access logs and generate http requests.
For those not familiar with the access log, it is the log the webserver maintains of every
request it accepted. This means every image, css file, javascript file, html file.... 
The current implementation is complete, but some features have not been enabled. 
There is a filter for the access log parser, but I haven't figured out how to link to the pre-processor. 
Once I do, changes to the sampler will be made to enable that functionality.</p>
<p>Tomcat uses the common format for access logs. This means any webserver that uses the
common log format can use the AccessLogSampler. Server that use common log format include:
Tomcat, Resin, Weblogic, and SunOne. Common log format looks
like this:</p>
<p>127.0.0.1 - - [21/Oct/2003:05:37:21 -0500] "GET /index.jsp?%2Findex.jsp= HTTP/1.1" 200 8343</p>
<note>The current implementation of the parser only looks at the text within the quotes that contains one of the HTTP protocol methods (GET, PUT, POST, DELETE...).
Everything else is stripped out and ignored. For example, the response code is completely
ignored by the parser. </note>
<p>For the future, it might be nice to filter out entries that
do not have a response code of 200. Extending the sampler should be fairly simple. There
are two interfaces you have to implement:</p>
<ul>
<li>org.apache.jmeter.protocol.http.util.accesslog.LogParser</li>
<li>org.apache.jmeter.protocol.http.util.accesslog.Generator</li>
</ul>
<p>The current implementation of AccessLogSampler uses the generator to create a new
HTTPSampler. The servername, port and get images are set by AccessLogSampler. Next,
the parser is called with integer 1, telling it to parse one entry. After that,
HTTPSampler.sample() is called to make the request.
<code>
<pre>
            samp = (HTTPSampler) GENERATOR.generateRequest();
            samp.setDomain(this.getDomain());
            samp.setPort(this.getPort());
            samp.setImageParser(this.isImageParser());
            PARSER.parse(1);
            res = samp.sample();
            res.setSampleLabel(samp.toString());
</pre>
</code>
The required methods in LogParser are:
<ul>
<li>setGenerator(Generator)</li>
<li>parse(int)</li> 
</ul>
Classes implementing Generator interface should provide concrete implementation
for all the methods. For an example of how to implement either interface, refer to
StandardGenerator and TCLogParser.
</p>

<properties>
        <property name="Name" required="No">Descriptive name for this sampler that is shown in the tree.</property>
        <property name="Server" required="Yes">Domain name or IP address of the web server.</property>
        <property name="Port" required="No (defaults to 80)">Port the web server is listening to.</property>
        <property name="Log parser class" required="Yes (default provided)">The log parser class is responsible for parsing the logs.</property>
        <property name="Filter" required="No">The filter class is used to filter out certain lines.</property>
        <property name="Location of log file" required="Yes">The location of the access log file.</property>
</properties>
<p>
The TCLogParser processes the access log independently for each thread.
The SharedTCLogParser and OrderPreservingLogParser share access to the file, 
i.e. each thread gets the next entry in the log.
</p>
<p>
The SessionFilter is intended to handle Cookies across threads. 
It does not filter out any entries, but modifies the cookie manager so that the cookies for a given IP are
processed by a single thread at a time. If two threads try to process samples from the same client IP address,
then one will be forced to wait until the other has completed.
</p>
<p>
The LogFilter is intended to allow access log entries to be filtered by filename and regex,
as well as allowing for the replacement of file extensions. However, it is not currently possible
to configure this via the GUI, so it cannot really be used.

<component name="BeanShell Sampler" index="&sect-num;.1.10"  width="1034" height="505" screenshot="beanshellsampler.png">
	<description><p>This sampler allows you to write a sampler using the BeanShell scripting language.		
</p><p>
<b>For full details on using BeanShell, please see the <a href="http://www.beanshell.org/">BeanShell website.</a></b>
</p>
<p>
The test element supports the ThreadListener and TestListener interface methods.
These must be defined in the initialisation file.
See the file BeanShellListeners.bshrc for example definitions.
</p>
<p>
From JMeter version 2.5.1, the BeanShell sampler also supports the Interruptible interface.
The interrupt() method can be defined in the script or the init file.
</p>
	</description>
<properties>
	<property name="Name" required="No">Descriptive name for this sampler that is shown in the tree.
    The name is stored in the script variable Label</property>
    <property name="Reset bsh.Interpreter before each call" required="Yes">
    If this option is selected, then the interpreter will be recreated for each sample.
    This may be necessary for some long running scripts. 
    For further information, see <a href="best-practices#bsh_scripting">Best Practices - BeanShell scripting</a>.
    </property>
    <property name="Parameters" required="No">Parameters to pass to the BeanShell script.
    This is intended for use with script files; for scripts defined in the GUI, you can use whatever
    variable and function references you need within the script itself.
	The parameters are stored in the following variables:
	<ul>
		<li>Parameters - string containing the parameters as a single variable</li>
	    <li>bsh.args - String array containing parameters, split on white-space</li>
	</ul></property>
    <property name="Script file" required="No">A file containing the BeanShell script to run.
    The file name is stored in the script variable FileName</property>
    <property name="Script" required="Yes (unless script file is provided)">The BeanShell script to run. 
    The return value (if not null) is stored as the sampler result.</property>
</properties>
<p>
N.B. Each Sampler instance has its own BeanShell interpeter,
and Samplers are only called from a single thread
</p><p>
If the property "beanshell.sampler.init" is defined, it is passed to the Interpreter
as the name of a sourced file.
This can be used to define common methods and variables. 
There is a sample init file in the bin directory: BeanShellSampler.bshrc.
</p><p>
If a script file is supplied, that will be used, otherwise the script will be used.</p>
<note>
JMeter processes function and variable references before passing the script field to the interpreter,
so the references will only be resolved once.
Variable and function references in script files will be passed
verbatim to the interpreter, which is likely to cause a syntax error.
In order to use runtime variables, please use the appropriate props methods,
e.g. props.get("START.HMS"); props.put("PROP1","1234");
<br/>
BeanShell does not currently support Java 5 syntax such as generics and the enhanced for loop.
</note>
		<p>Before invoking the script, some variables are set up in the BeanShell interpreter:
			</p>
				<p>The contents of the Parameters field is put into the variable "Parameters".
			The string is also split into separate tokens using a single space as the separator, and the resulting list
			is stored in the String array bsh.args.</p>
			<p>The full list of BeanShell variables that is set up is as follows:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>log - the Logger</li>
		<li>Label - the Sampler label</li>
		<li>FileName - the file name, if any</li>
		<li>Parameters - text from the Parameters field</li>
		<li>bsh.args - the parameters, split as described above</li>
		<li>SampleResult - pointer to the current SampleResult</li>
			<li>ResponseCode = 200</li>
			<li>ResponseMessage = "OK"</li>
			<li>IsSuccess = true</li>
			<li>ctx - <a href="../api/org/apache/jmeter/threads/JMeterContext.html">JMeterContext</a></li>
			<li>vars - <a href="../api/org/apache/jmeter/threads/JMeterVariables.html">JMeterVariables</a>  - e.g. vars.get("VAR1"); vars.put("VAR2","value"); vars.remove("VAR3"); vars.putObject("OBJ1",new Object());</li>
            <li>props - JMeterProperties (class java.util.Properties)- e.g. props.get("START.HMS"); props.put("PROP1","1234");</li>
		</ul>
		<p>When the script completes, control is returned to the Sampler, and it copies the contents
			of the following script variables into the corresponding variables in the <a href="../api/org/apache/jmeter/samplers/SampleResult.html">SampleResult</a>:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>ResponseCode - for example 200</li>
			<li>ResponseMessage - for example "OK"</li>
			<li>IsSuccess - true/false</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The SampleResult ResponseData is set from the return value of the script.
			Since version 2.1.2, if the script returns null, it can set the response directly, by using the method 
			SampleResult.setResponseData(data), where data is either a String or a byte array.
			The data type defaults to "text", but can be set to binary by using the method
			SampleResult.setDataType(SampleResult.BINARY).
			</p>
			<p>The SampleResult variable gives the script full access to all the fields and
				methods in the SampleResult. For example, the script has access to the methods
				setStopThread(boolean) and setStopTest(boolean).
				
				Here is a simple (not very useful!) example script:</p>
				
<pre>
if (bsh.args[0].equalsIgnoreCase("StopThread")) {
    log.info("Stop Thread detected!");
    SampleResult.setStopThread(true);
}
return "Data from sample with Label "+Label;
//or, since version 2.1.2
SampleResult.setResponseData("My data");
return null;
</pre>
<p>Another example:<br></br> ensure that the property <b>beanshell.sampler.init=BeanShellSampler.bshrc</b> is defined in jmeter.properties. 
The following script will show the values of all the variables in the ResponseData field:
</p>
<pre>
return getVariables();
</pre>
<p>

Beware however that misuse of any methods can cause subtle faults that may be difficult to find ...

<component name="JSR223 Sampler" index="&sect-num;.1.11.1">
<description>
<p>
The JSR223 Sampler allows JSR223 script code to be used to perform a sample.
JSR223 related elements have a feature that increases highly their performances.
To benefit from this feature:
<ul>
    <li>Use Script files instead of inlining them. This will make JMeter compile them if this feature is available on ScriptEngine and cache them.</li>
    <li>Use Script Text and fill in script cache key property, ensure it is unique accross Test Plan as JMeter will use it to cache result of compilation.
    <note>When using this feature, ensure you script code does not use JMeter variables directly in script code as caching would only cache first replacement. Instead use script parameters.</note>
    </li>
</ul>
Cache size is controlled by the following jmeter property (jmeter.properties):
<ul>
<li>jsr223.compiled_scripts_cache_size=100</li>
</ul>
For details, see <complink name="BSF Sampler"/>.
</p>
<note>Unlike the BeanShell sampler, the interpreter is not saved between invocations.</note>
<note>
Since JMeter 2.8, JSR223 Test Elements using Script file or Script text + cache key are now Compiled if ScriptEngine supports this feature, this enables great performance enhancements.
</note>
</description>
<note>
JMeter processes function and variable references before passing the script field to the interpreter,
so the references will only be resolved once.
Variable and function references in script files will be passed
verbatim to the interpreter, which is likely to cause a syntax error.
In order to use runtime variables, please use the appropriate props methods,
e.g. props.get("START.HMS"); props.put("PROP1","1234");

<component name="TCP Sampler" index="&sect-num;.1.12"  width="826" height="336" screenshot="tcpsampler.png">
	<description>
		<p>
		The TCP Sampler opens a TCP/IP connection to the specified server.
		It then sends the text, and waits for a response.
		<br></br>
		If "Re-use connection" is selected, connections are shared between Samplers in the same thread,
		provided that the exact same host name string and port are used. 
		Different hosts/port combinations will use different connections, as will different threads. 
		If both of "Re-use connection" and "Close connetion" are selected, the socket will be closed after running the sampler. 
		On the next sampler, another socket will be created. You may want to close a socket at the end of each thread loop.
		<br></br>
		If an error is detected - or "Re-use connection" is not selected - the socket is closed. 
		Another socket will be reopened on the next sample.
		<br></br>
		The following properties can be used to control its operation:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>tcp.status.prefix - text that precedes a status number</li>
			<li>tcp.status.suffix - text that follows a status number</li>
			<li>tcp.status.properties - name of property file to convert status codes to messages</li>
			<li>tcp.handler - Name of TCP Handler class (default TCPClientImpl) - only used if not specified on the GUI</li>
		</ul>
		The class that handles the connection is defined by the GUI, failing that the property tcp.handler. 
		If not found, the class is then searched for in the package org.apache.jmeter.protocol.tcp.sampler.
		<p>
		Users can provide their own implementation.
		The class must extend org.apache.jmeter.protocol.tcp.sampler.TCPClient.
		</p>
		<p>
		The following implementations are currently provided.
		<ul>
		<li>TCPClientImpl</li>
        <li>BinaryTCPClientImpl</li>
        <li>LengthPrefixedBinaryTCPClientImpl</li>
		</ul>
		The implementations behave as follows:
		</p>
		<p><b>TCPClientImpl</b><br></br>
		This implementation is fairly basic.
        When reading the response, it reads until the end of line byte, if this is defined
        by setting the property <b>tcp.eolByte</b>, otherwise until the end of the input stream.
        You can control charset encoding by setting <b>tcp.charset</b>, which will default to Platform default encoding.
        </p>
        <p><b>BinaryTCPClientImpl</b><br></br>
        This implementation converts the GUI input, which must be a hex-encoded string, into binary,
        and performs the reverse when reading the response.
        When reading the response, it reads until the end of message byte, if this is defined
        by setting the property <b>tcp.BinaryTCPClient.eomByte</b>, otherwise until the end of the input stream.
        </p>
        <p><b>LengthPrefixedBinaryTCPClientImpl</b><br></br>
        This implementation extends BinaryTCPClientImpl by prefixing the binary message data with a binary length byte.
        The length prefix defaults to 2 bytes.
        This can be changed by setting the property <b>tcp.binarylength.prefix.length</b>.
        </p>
        <p><b>Timeout handling</b>
        If the timeout is set, the read will be terminated when this expires. 
        So if you are using an eolByte/eomByte, make sure the timeout is sufficiently long,
        otherwise the read will be terminated early.    
		</p>
		<p><b>Response handling</b>
		<br></br>
		If tcp.status.prefix is defined, then the response message is searched for the text following
		that up to the suffix. If any such text is found, it is used to set the response code.
		The response message is then fetched from the properties file (if provided).
		<br></br>
		For example, if the prefix = "[" and the suffix = "]", then the following repsonse:
		<br></br>
		[J28] XI123,23,GBP,CR
		<br></br>
		would have the response code J28.
		<br></br>
		Response codes in the range "400"-"499" and "500"-"599" are currently regarded as failures;
		all others are successful. [This needs to be made configurable!]
		</p>
<note>The login name/password are not used by the supplied TCP implementations.</note>
		<br></br>
		Sockets are disconnected at the end of a test run.

</properties>
<p>
For the MapMessage type, JMeter reads the source as lines of text.
Each line must have 3 fields, delimited by commas.
The fields are:
<ul>
<li>Name of entry</li>
<li>Object class name, e.g. "String" (assumes java.lang package if not specified)</li>
<li>Object string value</li>
</ul>
For each entry, JMeter adds an Object with the given name.
The value is derived by creating an instance of the class, and using the valueOf(String) method to convert the value if necessary.
For example:
<pre>
name,String,Example
size,Integer,1234
</pre>
This is a very simple implementation; it is not intended to support all possible object types.
</p>
<p>
<note> 
The Object message is implemented since 2.7 and works as follow:
<ul>
<li>Put the JAR that contains your object and its dependencies in jmeter_home/lib/ folder</li>
<li>Serialize your object as XML using XStream</li>
<li>Either put result in a file suffixed with .txt or .obj or put XML content direclty in Text Area</li>  
</ul>
Note that if message is in a file, replacement of properties will not occur while it will if you use Text Area.

  Both of them create connections which can read messages. However they use a different strategy, as described below:
  <ul>
  <li>MessageConsumer.receive() - calls receive() for every requested message. 
  Retains the connection between samples, but does not fetch messages unless the sampler is active.
  This is best suited to Queue subscriptions. 
  </li>
  <li>MessageListener.onMessage() - establishes a Listener that stores all incoming messages on a queue. 
  The listener remains active after the sampler completes.
  This is best suited to Topic subscriptions.</li>
  </ul>
  </property>
  <property name="Stop between samples?" required="Yes">
  If selected, then JMeter calls Connection.stop() at the end of each sample (and calls start() before each sample).
  This may be useful in some cases where multiple samples/threads have connections to the same queue.
  If not selected, JMeter calls Connection.start() at the start of the thread, and does not call stop() until the end of the thread.

<p>
<b>NOTE:</b> JMeter 2.3.4 and earlier used a different strategy for the MessageConsumer.receive() client. 
Previously this started a background thread which polled for messages. This thread continued when the sampler
completed, so the net effect was similar to the MessageListener.onMessage() strategy.

    The Communication style can be <b>Request Only</b> (also known as Fire and Forget) or <b>Request Response</b>:
    <ul>
    <li><b>Request Only</b> will only send messages and will not monitor replies. As such it can be used to put load on a system.</li>
    <li><b>Request Response</b> will send messages and monitor the replies it receives. Behaviour depends on the value of the JNDI Name Reply Queue.
    If JNDI Name Reply Queue has a value, this queue is used to monitor the results. Matching of request and reply is done with
    the message id of the request and the correlation id of the reply. If the JNDI Name Reply Queue is empty, then
    temporary queues will be used for the communication between the requestor and the server.
    This is very different from the fixed reply queue. With temporary queues the sending thread will block until the reply message has been received.
    With <b>Request Response</b> mode, you need to have a Server that listens to messages sent to Request Queue and sends replies to

    <li><b>Use Response Message Id</b> - if selected, the response JMSMessageID will be used, 
    otherwise the response JMSCorrelationID will be used.
    </li>
    </ul>
    There are two frequently used JMS Correlation patterns:
    <ul>
    <li>JMS Correlation ID Pattern - 
    i.e. match request and response on their correlation Ids
    => deselect both checkboxes, and provide a correlation id.</li>
    <li>JMS Message ID Pattern -
    i.e. match request message id with response correlation id
    => select "Use Request Message Id" only.
    </li>
    </ul>
    In both cases the JMS application is responsible for populating the correlation ID as necessary.
    <note>if the same queue is used to send and receive messages, 
    then the response message will be the same as the request message.
    In which case, either provide a correlation id and clear both checkboxes;
    or select both checkboxes to use the message Id for correlation.
    This can be useful for checking raw JMS throughput.</note>

<component name="JUnit Request" index="&sect-num;.1.16"  width="397" height="536" screenshot="junit_sampler.png">
<description>
The current implementation supports standard Junit convention and extensions. It also
includes extensions like oneTimeSetUp and oneTimeTearDown. The sampler works like the
JavaSampler with some differences.
<br></br>1. rather than use Jmeter's test interface, it scans the jar files for classes extending junit's TestCase class. That includes any class or subclass.
<br></br>2. Junit test jar files should be placed in jmeter/lib/junit instead of /lib directory.
In versions of JMeter after 2.3.1, you can also use the "user.classpath" property to specify where to look for TestCase classes. 
<br></br>3. Junit sampler does not use name/value pairs for configuration like the JavaSampler. The sampler assumes setUp and tearDown will configure the test correctly.
<br></br>4. The sampler measures the elapsed time only for the test method and does not include setUp and tearDown.
<br></br>5. Each time the test method is called, Jmeter will pass the result to the listeners.
<br></br>6. Support for oneTimeSetUp and oneTimeTearDown is done as a method. Since Jmeter is multi-threaded, we cannot call oneTimeSetUp/oneTimeTearDown the same way Maven does it.
<br></br>7. The sampler reports unexpected exceptions as errors.
There are some important differences between standard JUnit test runners and JMeter's
implementation. Rather than make a new instance of the class for each test, JMeter
creates 1 instance per sampler and reuses it.
This can be changed with checkbox "Create a new instance per sample".<br></br>
The current implementation of the sampler will try to create an instance using the string constructor first. If the test class does not declare a string constructor, the sampler will look for an empty constructor. Example below:&lt;br>
&lt;br>
Empty Constructor:&lt;br>
public class myTestCase {&lt;br>
  public myTestCase() {}&lt;br>
}&lt;br>
&lt;br>
String Constructor:&lt;br>
public class myTestCase {&lt;br>
  public myTestCase(String text) {&lt;br>
    super(text);&lt;br>
  }&lt;br>
}&lt;br>
By default, Jmeter will provide some default values for the success/failure code and message. Users should define a set of unique success and failure codes and use them uniformly across all tests.&lt;br>
General Guidelines<br></br>
If you use setUp and tearDown, make sure the methods are declared public. If you do not, the test may not run properly.
<br></br>
Here are some general guidelines for writing Junit tests so they work well with Jmeter. Since Jmeter runs multi-threaded, it is important to keep certain things in mind.&lt;br>
&lt;br>
1. Write the setUp and tearDown methods so they are thread safe. This generally means avoid using static memebers.&lt;br>
2. Make the test methods discrete units of work and not long sequences of actions. By keeping the test method to a descrete operation, it makes it easier to combine test methods to create new test plans.&lt;br>
3. Avoid making test methods depend on each other. Since Jmeter allows arbitrary sequencing of test methods, the runtime behavior is different than the default Junit behavior.&lt;br>
4. If a test method is configurable, be careful about where the properties are stored. Reading the properties from the Jar file is recommended.&lt;br>
5. Each sampler creates an instance of the test class, so write your test so the setup happens in oneTimeSetUp and oneTimeTearDown.

The following JUnit4 annotations are recognised:
<ul>
<li>@Test - used to find test methods and classes. The "expected" and "timeout" attributes are supported.</li>
<li>@Before - treated the same as setUp() in JUnit3</li>
<li>@After - treated the same as tearDown() in JUnit3</li>
<li>@BeforeClass, @AfterClass - treated as test methods so they can be run independently as required</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Note that JMeter currently runs the test methods directly, rather than leaving it to JUnit.
This is to allow the setUp/tearDown methods to be excluded from the sample time.

<b>Special handling for "file" protocol:</b><br></br>
The <code>file</code> JavaMail provider can be used to read raw messages from files.
The <code>server</code> field is used to specify the path to the parent of the <code>folder</code>.
Individual message files should be stored with the name <code>n.msg</code>,

<component name="Test Action" index="&sect-num;.1.18" width="467" height="184" screenshot="test_action.png">
<description>
The Test Action sampler is a sampler that is intended for use in a conditional controller.
Rather than generate a sample, the test element eithers pauses or stops the selected target.
<p>This sampler can also be useful in conjunction with the Transaction Controller, as it allows
pauses to be included without needing to generate a sample. 
For variable delays, set the pause time to zero, and add a Timer as a child.</p>
<p>
The "Stop" action stops the thread or test after completing any samples that are in progress.
The "Stop Now" action stops the test without waiting for samples to complete; it will interrupt any active samples.
If some threads fail to stop within the 5 second time-limit, a message will be displayed in GUI mode.
You can try using the Stop command to see if this will stop the threads, but if not, you should exit JMeter.
In non-GUI mode, JMeter will exit if some threads fail to stop within the 5 second time limit.
[This can be changed using the JMeter property <code>jmeterengine.threadstop.wait</code>]

<p>
The OS Process Sampler is a sampler that can be used to execute commands on the local machine.<br></br>
It should allow execution of any command that can be run from the command line.<br></br>
Validation of the return code can be enabled, and the expected return code can be specified.<br></br>
</p>
<p>
Note that OS shells generally provide command-line parsing. 
This varies between OSes, but generally the shell will split parameters on white-space.
Some shells expand wild-card file names; some don't.
The quoting mechanism also varies between OSes.
The sampler deliberately does not do any parsing or quote handling.
The command and its parameters must be provided in the form expected by the executable.
This means that the sampler settings will not be portable between OSes.
</p>
<p>
Many OSes have some built-in commands which are not provided as separate executables. 
For example the Windows DIR command is part of the command interpreter (CMD.EXE).
These built-ins cannot be run as independent programs, but have to be provided as arguments to the appropriate command interpreter.
</p>
<p>
For example, the Windows command-line: <b><code>DIR C:\TEMP</code></b> needs to be specified as follows:
<pre>

Simple Logic Controllers.  Remember, the Simple Logic Controller has no effect on how JMeter
processes the controller(s) you add to it.  So, in this example, JMeter sends the requests in the
following order: Ant Home Page, Ant News Page, Log4J Home Page, Log4J History Page.
Note, the File Reporter

<figure width="548" height="160" image="logic-controller/loop-example.png">Figure 4 - Loop Controller Example</figure>

<p>We configured the Thread Group for a single thread and a loop count value of

during further iterations through the test plan.</p>

<p>The Once Only Controller will now execute always during the first iteration of any looping parent controller.  
Thus, if the Once Only Controller is placed under a Loop Controller specified to loop 5 times, then the Once Only Controller will execute only on the first iteration through the Loop Controller 
(ie, every 5 times).  
Note this means the Once Only Controller will still behave as previously expected if put under a Thread Group (runs only once per test per Thread), 
but now the user has more flexibility in the use of the Once Only Controller.</p>

<p>For testing that requires a login, consider placing the login request in this controller since each thread only needs
to login once to establish a session.</p>

		<p>The If Controller allows the user to control whether the test elements below it (its children) are run or not.</p>
		<p>
		Prior to JMeter 2.3RC3, the condition was evaluated for every runnable element contained in the controller.
		This sometimes caused unexpected behaviour, so 2.3RC3 was changed to evaluate the condition only once on initial entry.
		However, the original behaviour is also useful, so versions of JMeter after 2.3RC4 have an additional
		option to select the original behaviour.
		</p>
		<p>
		Versions of JMeter after 2.3.2 allow the script to be processed as a variable expression, rather than requiring Javascript.
		It was always possible to use functions and variables in the Javascript condition, so long as they evaluated to "true" or "false";
		now this can be done without the overhead of using Javascript as well. For example, previously one could use the condition:
		<code>${__jexl(${VAR} == 23)}</code> and this would be evaluated as true/false, the result would then be passed to Javascript
		which would then return true/false. If the Variable Expression option is selected, then the expression is evaluated
		and compared with "true", without needing to use Javascript. 
		Also, variable expressions can return any value, whereas the
		Javascript condition must return "true"/"false" or an error is logged.
		</p>
		<note>
		No variables are made available to the script when the condition is interpreted as Javascript.
		If you need access to such variables, then select "Interpret Condition as Variable Expression?" and use
		a __javaScript() function call. You can then use the objects "vars", "log", "ctx" etc. in the script.
		</note>
		<note>
		To test if a variable is undefined (or null) do the following, suppose var is named myVar, expression will be:
        <br></br>
        <code>"${myVar}" == "\${myVar}"</code>
        <br></br>

        <br></br>
        <code>"${myVar}" != "\${myVar}"</code>
        <br></br>
        to test if a variable is defined and is not null.

<p>
The While Controller runs its children until the condition is "false".
</p>

<p>Possible condition values:</p>
<ul>
<li>blank - exit loop when last sample in loop fails</li>
<li>LAST - exit loop when last sample in loop fails. 
If the last sample just before the loop failed, don't enter loop.</li>
<li>Otherwise - exit (or don't enter) the loop when the condition is equal to the string "false"</li>

The condition can be any variable or function that eventually evaluates to the string "false". 
This allows the use of JavaScript, BeanShell, properties or variables as needed.

<component name="Switch Controller" index="&sect-num;.2.11" width="361" height="106" screenshot="switchcontroller.png">
	<description>
<p>
The Switch Controller acts like the <complink name="Interleave Controller"/> 
in that it runs one of the subordinate elements on each iteration, but rather than
run them in sequence, the controller runs the element defined by the switch value.
</p>
<p>
Note: In versions of JMeter after 2.3.1, the switch value can also be a name.
</p>
<p>If the switch value is out of range, it will run the zeroth element, 
which therefore acts as the default for the numeric case.
It also runs the zeroth element if the value is the empty string.</p>
<p>
If the value is non-numeric (and non-empty), then the Switch Controller looks for the
element with the same name (case is significant).
If none of the names match, then the element named "default" (case not significant) is selected.
If there is no default, then no element is selected, and the controller will not run anything.

<component name="ForEach Controller" index="&sect-num;.2.12" anchor="loop" width="380" height="152" screenshot="logic-controller/foreach-controller.png">
<description><p>A ForEach controller loops through the values of a set of related variables. 
When you add samplers (or controllers) to a ForEach controller, every sample sample (or controller)
is executed one or more times, where during every loop the variable has a new value.
The input should consist of several variables, each extended with an underscore and a number.
Each such variable must have a value.
So for example when the input variable has the name inputVar, the following variables should have been defined:
		<ul>
		<li>inputVar_1 = wendy</li>
		<li>inputVar_2 = charles</li>
		<li>inputVar_3 = peter</li>
		<li>inputVar_4 = john</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Note: the "_" separator is now optional.</p>
When the return variable is given as "returnVar", the collection of samplers and controllers under the ForEach controller will be executed 4 consecutive times,
with the return variable having the respective above values, which can then be used in the samplers.
</p>
<p>
It is especially suited for running with the regular expression post-processor. 
This can "create" the necessary input variables out of the result data of a previous request.
By omitting the "_" separator, the ForEach Controller can be used to loop through the groups by using
the input variable refName_g, and can also loop through all the groups in all the matches
by using an input variable of the form refName_${C}_g, where C is a counter variable.
</p>
<note>The ForEach Controller does not run any samples if inputVar_1 is null.
This would be the case if the Regular Expression returned no matches.</note>

<p><a href="../demos/forEachTestPlan.jmx">Download</a> this example (see Figure 7).
In this example, we created a Test Plan that sends a particular HTTP Request
only once and sends another HTTP Request to every link that can be found on the page.</p>

<figure width="246" height="154" image="logic-controller/foreach-example.png">Figure 7 - ForEach Controller Example</figure>

<p>We configured the Thread Group for a single thread and a loop count value of
one. You can see that we added one HTTP Request to the Thread Group and
another HTTP Request to the ForEach Controller.</p>
<p>After the first HTTP request, a regular expression extractor is added, which extracts all the html links
out of the return page and puts them in the inputVar variable</p>
<p>In the ForEach loop, a HTTP sampler is added which requests all the links that were extracted from the first returned HTML page.
</p></example>
<example title="ForEach Example" anchor="foreach_example2">
<p>Here is <a href="../demos/ForEachTest2.jmx">another example</a> you can download. 
This has two Regular Expressions and ForEach Controllers.
The first RE matches, but the second does not match,

<p>The Thread Group has a single thread and a loop count of two.

Sample 1 uses the JavaTest Sampler to return the string "a b c d".
</p><p>The Regex Extractor uses the expression <b>(\w)\s</b> which matches a letter followed by a space,
and returns the letter (not the space). Any matches are prefixed with the string "inputVar".
</p><p>The ForEach Controller extracts all variables with the prefix "inputVar_", and executes its
sample, passing the value in the variable "returnVar". In this case it will set the variable to the values "a" "b" and "c" in turn.
</p><p>The For 1 Sampler is another Java Sampler which uses the return variable "returnVar" as part of the sample Label
and as the sampler Data.
</p><p>Sample 2, Regex 2 and For 2 are almost identical, except that the Regex has been changed to "(\w)\sx",
which clearly won't match. Thus the For 2 Sampler will not be run.

<component name="Module Controller" index="&sect-num;.2.13" width="504" height="217" screenshot="module_controller.png">
<description>
<p>
The Module Controller provides a mechanism for substituting test plan fragments into the current test plan at run-time.
</p>
<p>
A test plan fragment consists of a Controller and all the test elements (samplers etc) contained in it. 
The fragment can be located in any Thread Group, or on the <complink name="WorkBench" />.
If the fragment is located in a Thread Group, then its Controller can be disabled to prevent the fragment being run
except by the Module Controller. 
Or you can store the fragments in a dummy Thread Group, and disable the entire Thread Group. 
</p>
<p>
There can be multiple fragments, each with a different series of
samplers under them.  The module controller can then be used to easily switch between these multiple test cases simply by choosing
the appropriate controller in its drop down box.  This provides convenience for running many alternate test plans quickly and easily.
</p>
<p>
A fragment name is made up of the Controller name and all its parent names.
For example:
<pre>
Test Plan / Protocol: JDBC / Control / Interleave Controller (Module1)
</pre>
Any <b>fragments used by the Module Controller must have a unique name</b>,
as the name is used to find the target controller when a test plan is reloaded.
For this reason it is best to ensure that the Controller name is changed from the default
- as shown in the example above -
otherwise a duplicate may be accidentally created when new elements are added to the test plan. 
</p>
<note>Renaming any element used in ModuleController implies updating Module to Run field</note>
</description>
<note>The Module Controller should not be used with remote testing or non-gui testing in conjunction with Workbench components since the Workbench test elements are not part of test plan .jmx files.  Any such test will fail.</note>

<component name="Include Controller" index="&sect-num;.2.14" width="417" height="130" screenshot="includecontroller.png">
	<description>
<p>
The include controller is designed to use an external jmx file. To use it, create a Test Fragment 
underneath the Test Plan and add any desired samplers, controllers etc. below it.
Then save the Test Plan.  The file is now ready to be included as part of other Test Plans.
</p>
<p>
For convenience, a Thread Group can also be added in the external JMX file for debugging purposes.
A Module Controller can be used to reference the Test Fragment.  The Thread Group will be ignored during the 
include process.
</p>
<p>
If the test uses a Cookie Manager or User Defined Variables, these should be placed in the top-level
test plan, not the included file, otherwise they are not guaranteed to work.

attempts to open the fileName relative to the JMX launch directory (versions of JMeter after 2.3.4).

	<description>
	    <p>
	    The Transaction Controller generates an additional
	    sample which measures the overall time taken to perform the nested test elements.
	    Note that this time by default includes all processing within the controller scope, not just
	    the samples, this can be changed by unchecking "Include duration of timer and pre-post processors in generated sample".
	    </p>
	    <p>
	    For JMeter versions after 2.3, there are two modes of operation
	    <ul>
	    <li>additional sample is added after the nested samples</li>
	    <li>additional sample is added as a parent of the nested samples</li>
	    </ul>
	    </p>
		<p>
		The generated sample time includes all the times for the nested samplers, <b>and any timers etc.</b>
		Depending on the clock resolution, it may be slightly longer than the sum of the individual samplers plus timers.
		The clock might tick after the controller recorded the start time but before the first sample starts.
		Similarly at the end.
		</p>
		<p>The generated sample is only regarded as successful if all its sub-samples are successful.</p>
		<p>
		In parent mode, the individual samples can still be seen in the Tree View Listener,
		but no longer appear as separate entries in other Listeners.
		Also, the sub-samples do not appear in CSV log files, but they can be saved to XML files.
		</p>
		<note>
		In parent mode, Assertions (etc) can be added to the Transaction Controller.
		However by default they will be applied to both the individual samples and the overall transaction sample.
		To limit the scope of the Assertions, use a Simple Controller to contain the samples, and add the Assertions
		to the Simple Controller.
		Parent mode controllers do not currently properly support nested transaction controllers of either type.

<section name="&sect-num;.3 Listeners" anchor="listeners">
<description>
	<br></br>
Most of the listeners perform several roles in addition to "listening"
to the test results.  
They also provide means to view, save, and read saved test results.
<p>Note that Listeners are processed at the end of the scope in which they are found.</p>
<p>
The saving and reading of test results is generic.  The various
listeners have a panel whereby one can specify the file to
which the results will be written (or read from).
By default, the results are stored as XML
files, typically with a ".jtl" extension.
Storing as CSV is the most efficient option, but is less detailed than XML (the other available option).
</p>
<p>
<b>Listeners do <i>not</i> process sample data in non-GUI mode, but the raw data will be saved if an output
file has been configured.</b>
In order to analyse the data generated by a non-GUI test run, you need to load the file into the appropriate
Listener.
</p>
<note>
To read existing results and display them, use the file panel Browse button to open the file.
</note>
<p>
Versions of JMeter up to 2.3.2 <b>used to clear any current data</b> before loading the new file.<br></br>
This is no longer done, thus <b>allowing files to be merged</b>.
If the previous behaviour is required, 
use the menu item Run/Clear (Ctrl+Shift+E) or Run/Clear All (Ctrl+E) before loading the file.
</p>
<p>Results can be read from XML or CSV format files.
When reading from CSV results files, the header (if present) is used to determine which fields are present.
<b>In order to interpret a header-less CSV file correctly, the appropriate properties must be set in jmeter.properties.</b>
</p>
<note>
The file name can contain function and/or variable references.
However variable references do not work in client-server mode (functions work OK).
</note>
<p><b>Listeners can use a lot of memory if there are a lot of samples.</b>
Most of the listeners currently keep a copy of every sample in their scope, apart from:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Simple Data Writer</li>
<li>BeanShell/BSF Listener</li>
<li>Mailer Visualizer</li>
<li>Monitor Results</li>
<li>Summary Report</li>
</ul>
<p>
The following Listeners no longer need to keep copies of every single sample.
Instead, samples with the same elapsed time are aggregated.
Less memory is now needed, especially if most samples only take a second or two at most.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Aggregate Report</li>
<li>Aggregate Graph</li>
<li>Distribution Graph</li>
</ul>
<p>To minimise the amount of memory needed, use the Simple Data Writer, and use the CSV format.</p>
<p>
<note>
Versions of JMeter after 2.3.1 allow JMeter variables to be saved to the output files.
This can only be specified using a property.
See the <a href="listeners.html#sample_variables">Listener Sample Variables</a> for details
</note>
For full details on setting up the default items to be saved

</p>
<note>The entries in jmeter.properties are used to define the defaults; 
these can be overriden for individual listeners by using the Configure button,
as shown below. 
The settings in jmeter.properties also apply to the listener that is added
by using the -l command-line flag.

the bottom of the graph, the current sample (black), the current average of all samples(blue), the

<p>The throughput number represents the actual number of requests/minute the server handled.  This calculation
includes any delays you added to your test and JMeter's own internal processing time.  The advantage
of doing the calculation like this is that this number represents something
real - your server in fact handled that many requests per minute, and you can increase the number of threads
and/or decrease the delays to discover your server's maximum throughput.  Whereas if you made calculations
that factored out delays and JMeter's processing, it would be unclear what you could conclude from that
number.</p></description>

<component name="Aggregate Report" index="&sect-num;.3.7"  width="784" height="287" screenshot="aggregate_report.png">
<description>The aggregate report creates a table row for each differently named request in your
test.  For each request, it totals the response information and provides request count, min, max,
average, error rate, approximate throughput (request/second) and Kilobytes per second throughput.
Once the test is done, the throughput is the actual through for the duration of the entire test.
<p>
The thoughput is calculated from the point of view of the sampler target 
(e.g. the remote server in the case of HTTP samples).
JMeter takes into account the total time over which the requests have been generated.
If other samplers and timers are in the same thread, these will increase the total time,
and therefore reduce the throughput value. 
So two identical samplers with different names will have half the throughput of two samplers with the same name.
It is important to choose the sampler names correctly to get the best results from
the Aggregate Report.
</p>
<p>
Calculation of the <a href="glossary.html#Median">Median</a> and 90% Line (90<sup>th</sup> <a href="glossary.html#Percentile">percentile</a>) values requires additional memory.
For JMeter 2.3.4 and earlier, details of each sample were saved separately, which meant a lot of memory was needed.
JMeter now combines samples with the same elapsed time, so far less memory is used.
However, for samples that take more than a few seconds, the probability is that fewer samples will have identical times,
in which case more memory will be needed.
See the <complink name="Summary Report"/> for a similar Listener that does not store individual samples and so needs constant memory.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Label - The label of the sample.
If "Include group name in label?" is selected, then the name of the thread group is added as a prefix.
This allows identical labels from different thread groups to be collated separately if required.
</li>
<li># Samples - The number of samples with the same label</li>
<li>Average - The average time of a set of results</li>
<li>Median - The <a href="glossary.html#Median">median</a> is the time in the middle of a set of results.
50% of the samples took no more than this time; the remainder took at least as long.</li>
<li>90% Line - 90% of the samples took no more than this time.
The remaining samples at least as long as this. (90<sup>th</sup> <a href="glossary.html#Percentile">percentile</a>)</li>
<li>Min - The shortest time for the samples with the same label</li>
<li>Max - The longest time for the samples with the same label</li>
<li>Error % - Percent of requests with errors</li>
<li>Throughput - the <a href="glossary.html#Throughput">Throughput</a> is measured in requests per second/minute/hour.
The time unit is chosen so that the displayed rate is at least 1.0.
When the throughput is saved to a CSV file, it is expressed in requests/second,
i.e. 30.0 requests/minute is saved as 0.5.
</li>
<li>Kb/sec - The throughput measured in Kilobytes per second</li>

<component name="Monitor Results" index="&sect-num;.3.10"  width="762" height="757" screenshot="monitor_screencap.png">
<description>
<p>Monitor Results is a new Visualizer for displaying server
status. It is designed for Tomcat 5, but any servlet container
can port the status servlet and use this monitor. There are two primary
tabs for the monitor. The first is the "Health" tab, which will show the
status of one or more servers. The second tab labled "Performance" shows
the performance for one server for the last 1000 samples. The equations
used for the load calculation is included in the Visualizer.</p>
<p>Currently, the primary limitation of the monitor is system memory. A
quick benchmark of memory usage indicates a buffer of 1000 data points for
100 servers would take roughly 10Mb of RAM. On a 1.4Ghz centrino
laptop with 1Gb of ram, the monitor should be able to handle several
hundred servers.</p>
<p>As a general rule, monitoring production systems should take care to
set an appropriate interval. Intervals shorter than 5 seconds are too
aggressive and have a potential of impacting the server. With a buffer of
1000 data points at 5 second intervals, the monitor would check the server
status 12 times a minute or 720 times a hour. This means the buffer shows
the performance history of each machine for the last hour.</p>
<note>
The monitor requires Tomcat 5 or above. 
Use a browser to check that you can access the Tomcat status servlet OK.

<component name="Distribution Graph (alpha)" index="&sect-num;.3.11"  width="819" height="626" screenshot="distribution_graph.png">
<description>
<note>
Distribution Graph MUST NOT BE USED during load test as it consumes a lot of resources (memory and CPU). Use it only for either functional testing or 
during Test Plan debugging and Validation.
</note>

<p>The distribution graph will display a bar for every unique response time. Since the
granularity of System.currentTimeMillis() is 10 milliseconds, the 90% threshold should be
within the width of the graph. The graph will draw two threshold lines: 50% and 90%.
What this means is 50% of the response times finished between 0 and the line. The same
is true of 90% line. Several tests with Tomcat were performed using 30 threads for 600K
requests. The graph was able to display the distribution without any problems and both
the 50% and 90% line were within the width of the graph. A performant application will
generally produce results that clump together. A poorly written application that has
memory leaks may result in wild fluctuations. In those situations, the threshold lines
may be beyond the width of the graph. The recommended solution to this specific problem
is fix the webapp so it performs well. If your test plan produces distribution graphs
with no apparent clumping or pattern, it may indicate a memory leak. The only way to
know for sure is to use a profiling tool.</p>

JMeter takes into account the total time over which the requests have been generated.
If other samplers and timers are in the same thread, these will increase the total time,

<component name="Generate Summary Results" index="&sect-num;.3.19"  width="358" height="131" screenshot="summary.png">
    <description>This test element can be placed anywhere in the test plan.
Generates a summary of the test run so far to the log file and/or 
standard output. Both running and differential totals are shown.
Output is generated every n seconds (default 3 minutes) on the appropriate
time boundary, so that multiple test runs on the same time will be synchronised.
See jmeter.properties file for the summariser configuration items:
<pre>
# Define the following property to automatically start a summariser with that name
# (applies to non-GUI mode only)
#summariser.name=summary
#
# interval between summaries (in seconds) default 3 minutes
#summariser.interval=180
#
# Write messages to log file
#summariser.log=true
#
# Write messages to System.out
#summariser.out=true
</pre>
This element is mainly intended for batch (non-GUI) runs.
The output looks like the following:
<pre>
label +   171 in  20.3s =    8.4/s Avg:  1129 Min:  1000 Max:  1250 Err:     0 (0.00%)
label +   263 in  31.3s =    8.4/s Avg:  1138 Min:  1000 Max:  1250 Err:     0 (0.00%)
label =   434 in  50.4s =    8.6/s Avg:  1135 Min:  1000 Max:  1250 Err:     0 (0.00%)
label +   263 in  31.0s =    8.5/s Avg:  1138 Min:  1000 Max:  1250 Err:     0 (0.00%)
label =   697 in  80.3s =    8.7/s Avg:  1136 Min:  1000 Max:  1250 Err:     0 (0.00%)
label +   109 in  12.4s =    8.8/s Avg:  1092 Min:    47 Max:  1250 Err:     0 (0.00%)
label =   806 in  91.6s =    8.8/s Avg:  1130 Min:    47 Max:  1250 Err:     0 (0.00%)
</pre>
The "label" is the the name of the element.
The "+" means that the line is a delta line, i.e. shows the changes since the last output.
The "=" means that the line is a totals line, i.e. it shows the running total.
Entries in the jmeter log file also include time-stamps.
The example "806 in  91.6s =    8.8/s" means that there were 806 samples recorded in 91.6 seconds,
and that works out at 8.8 samples per second.
The Avg (Average), Min(imum) and Max(imum) times are in milliseconds.
"Err" means number of errors (also shown as percentage).
The last two lines will appear at the end of a test.
They will not be synchronised to the appropriate time boundary.
Note that the initial and final deltas may be for less than the interval (in the example above this is 30 seconds).
The first delta will generally be lower, as JMeter synchronises to the interval boundary.
The last delta will be lower, as the test will generally not finish on an exact interval boundary.
<p>
The label is used to group sample results together. 
So if you have multiple Thread Groups and want to summarize across them all, then use the same label
 - or add the summariser to the Test Plan (so all thread groups are in scope).
Different summary groupings can be implemented
by using suitable labels and adding the summarisers to appropriate parts of the test plan.

<component name="CSV Data Set Config" index="&sect-num;.4.1"  width="433" height="281" screenshot="csvdatasetconfig.png">
<description>
    <p>
	CSV Data Set Config is used to read lines from a file, and split them into variables.
	It is easier to use than the __CSVRead() and _StringFromFile() functions.
	It is well suited to handling large numbers of variables, and is also useful for tesing with
	"random" and unique values.
	Generating unique random values at run-time is expensive in terms of CPU and memory, so just create the data
	in advance of the test. If necessary, the "random" data from the file can be used in conjunction with
	a run-time parameter to create different sets of values from each run - e.g. using concatenation - which is
	much cheaper than generating everything at run-time.
    </p>
    <p>
	Versions of JMeter after 2.3.1 allow values to be quoted; this allows the value to contain a delimiter.
	Previously it was necessary to choose a delimiter that was not used in any values.
    If "allow quoted data" is enabled, a value may be enclosed in double-quotes.
    These are removed. To include double-quotes within a quoted field, use two double-quotes.
    For example:<pre>
1,"2,3","4""5" =>
1
2,3
4"5
</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
	Versions of JMeter after 2.3.4 support CSV files which have a header line defining the column names.
	To enable this, leave the "Variable Names" field empty. The correct delimiter must be provided.
	</p>
    <p>
    Versions of JMeter after 2.7 support CSV files with quoted data that includes new-lines.
    </p>
	<p>
	By default, the file is only opened once, and each thread will use a different line from the file.
	However the order in which lines are passed to threads depends on the order in which they execute,
	which may vary between iterations.
	Lines are read at the start of each test iteration.
    The file name and mode are resolved in the first iteration.
	</p>
	<p>
	See the description of the Share mode below for additional options (JMeter 2.3.2+).
	If you want each thread to have its own set of values, then you will need to create a set of files,
	one for each thread. For example test1.csv, test2.csv,... testn.csv. Use the filename 
	<code>test${__threadNum}.csv</code> and set the "Sharing mode" to "Current thread".
	</p>
	<note>CSV Dataset variables are defined at the start of each test iteration.
	As this is after configuration processing is completed,
	they cannot be used for some configuration items - such as JDBC Config - 
	that process their contents at configuration time (see <a href="http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=40934">Bug 40394 </a>)
	However the variables do work in the HTTP Auth Manager, as the username etc are processed at run-time.
	</note>
	<p>
	As a special case, the string "\t" (without quotes) in the delimiter field is treated as a Tab.
	</p>
	<p>
	When the end of file (EOF) is reached, and the recycle option is true, reading starts again with the first line of the file.
	</p>
	<p>
	If the recycle option is false, and stopThread is false, then all the variables are set to <b>&amp;lt;EOF&gt;</b> when the end of file is reached.
	This value can be changed by setting the JMeter property <b>csvdataset.eofstring</b>.
	</p>
	<p>
	If the Recycle option is false, and Stop Thread is true, then reaching EOF will cause the thread to be stopped.

  <b>For distributed testing, the CSV file must be stored on the server host system in the correct relative directory to where the jmeter server is started.</b>
  Absolute file names are also supported, but note that they are unlikely to work in remote mode, 
  unless the remote server has the same directory structure.
  If the same physical file is referenced in two different ways - e.g. csvdata.txt and ./csvdata.txt -
  then these are treated as different files.
  If the OS does not distinguish between upper and lower case, csvData.TXT would also be opened separately. 
  </property>

  <property name="Variable Names" required="Yes">List of variable names (comma-delimited).
  Versions of JMeter after 2.3.4 support CSV header lines:

  The names must be separated by the delimiter character. They can be quoted using double-quotes.
  </property>
  <property name="Delimiter" required="Yes">Delimiter to be used to split the records in the file.
  If there are fewer values on the line than there are variables the remaining variables are not updated -

  <li>Current thread - each file is opened separately for each thread</li>
  <li>Identifier - all threads sharing the same identifier share the same file.
  So for example if you have 4 thread groups, you could use a common id for two or more of the groups
  to share the file between them.
  Or you could use the thread number to share the file between the same thread numbers in different thread groups.

<note>If there is more than one Authorization Manager in the scope of a Sampler,
there is currently no way to specify which one is to be used.</note>

<description>
<p>The Authorization Manager lets you specify one or more user logins for web pages that are
restricted using server authentication.  You see this type of authentication when you use
your browser to access a restricted page, and your browser displays a login dialog box.  JMeter
transmits the login information when it encounters this type of page.</p>
<p>
The Authorisation headers are not shown in the Tree View Listener.
</p>
<p>
In versions of JMeter after 2.2, the HttpClient sampler defaults to pre-emptive authentication
if the setting has not been defined. To disable this, set the values as below, in which case
authentication will only be performed in response to a challenge.
<pre>
jmeter.properties:
httpclient.parameters.file=httpclient.parameters

httpclient.parameters:
http.authentication.preemptive$Boolean=false
</pre>
Note: the above settings only apply to the HttpClient sampler (and the SOAP samplers, which use Httpclient).
</p>
<note>
When looking for a match against a URL, JMeter checks each entry in turn, and stops when it finds the first match.
Thus the most specific URLs should appear first in the list, followed by less specific ones.
Duplicate URLs will be ignored.
If you want to use different usernames/passwords for different threads, you can use variables.
These can be set up using a <complink name="CSV Data Set Config"/> Element (for example).

<p><a href="../demos/AuthManagerTestPlan.jmx">Download</a> this example.  In this example, we created a Test Plan on a local server that sends three HTTP requests, two requiring a login and the
other is open to everyone.  See figure 10 to see the makeup of our Test Plan.  On our server, we have a restricted
directory named, "secret", which contains two files, "index.html" and "index2.html".  We created a login id named, "kevin",
which has a password of "spot".  So, in our Authorization Manager, we created an entry for the restricted directory and
a username and password (see figure 11).  The two HTTP requests named "SecretPage1" and "SecretPage2" make requests
to "/secret/index.html" and "/secret/index2.html".  The other HTTP request, named "NoSecretPage" makes a request to
"/index.html".</p>

<figure width="539" height="241" image="http-config/auth-manager-example1b.png">Figure 11 - Authorization Manager Control Panel</figure>

<p>When we run the Test Plan, JMeter looks in the Authorization table for the URL it is requesting.  If the Base URL matches
the URL, then JMeter passes this information along with the request.</p>

be able to run it.  However, you can use it as a reference in constructing your own Test Plan.</note>

<component name="HTTP Cache Manager" index="&sect-num;.4.4"  width="511" height="196" screenshot="http-config/http-cache-manager.png">

<note>This is a new element, and is liable to change</note>

<description>
<p>
The HTTP Cache Manager is used to add caching functionality to HTTP requests within its scope.
</p>
<p>
If a sample is successful (i.e. has response code 2xx) then the Last-Modified and Etag (and Expired if relevant) values are saved for the URL.
Before executing the next sample, the sampler checks to see if there is an entry in the cache, 
and if so, the If-Last-Modified and If-None-Match conditional headers are set for the request.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, if the "Use Cache-Control/Expires header" option is selected, then the Cache-Control/Expires value is checked against the current time.
If the request is a GET request, and the timestamp is in the future, then the sampler returns immediately,
without requesting the URL from the remote server. This is intended to emulate browser behaviour.
Note that if Cache-Control header is "no-cache", the response will be stored in cache as pre-expired,
so will generate a conditional GET request.
If Cache-Control has any other value, 
the "max-age" expiry option is processed to compute entry lifetime, if missing then expire header will be used, if also missing entry will be cached 
as specified in <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt">RFC 2616</a> section 13.2.4. using Last-Modified time and response Date.
</p>
<p>
By default, Cache Manager will store up to 5000 items in cache using LRU algorithm. Use property to modify this value.
Note that the more you increase this value the more HTTP Cache Manager will consume memory, so be sure to adapt -Xmx option.
</p>
<p>
If the requested document has not changed since it was cached, then the response body will be empty.
Likewise if the Expires date is in the future.
This may cause problems for Assertions.

<component name="HTTP Cookie Manager" index="&sect-num;.4.4"  width="513" height="383" screenshot="http-config/http-cookie-manager.png">

<note>If there is more than one Cookie Manager in the scope of a Sampler,
there is currently no way to specify which one is to be used.
Also, a cookie stored in one cookie manager is not available to any other manager,
so use multiple Cookie Managers with care.</note>

<description><p>The Cookie Manager element has two functions:<br></br>
First, it stores and sends cookies just like a web browser. If you have an HTTP Request and
the response contains a cookie, the Cookie Manager automatically stores that cookie and will
use it for all future requests to that particular web site.  Each JMeter thread has its own
"cookie storage area".  So, if you are testing a web site that uses a cookie for storing
session information, each JMeter thread will have its own session.
Note that such cookies do not appear on the Cookie Manager display, but they can be seen using
the <complink name="View Results Tree"/> Listener.
</p>
<p>
JMeter version 2.3.2 and earlier did not check that received cookies were valid for the URL.
This meant that cross-domain cookies were stored, and might be used later.
This has been fixed in later versions.
To revert to the earlier behaviour, define the JMeter property "CookieManager.check.cookies=false".
</p>
<p>
Received Cookies can be stored as JMeter thread variables
(versions of JMeter after 2.3.2 no longer do this by default).
To save cookies as variables, define the property "CookieManager.save.cookies=true".
Also, cookies names are prefixed with "COOKIE_" before they are stored (this avoids accidental corruption of local variables)
To revert to the original behaviour, define the property "CookieManager.name.prefix= " (one or more spaces).
If enabled, the value of a cookie with the name TEST can be referred to as ${COOKIE_TEST}.
</p>
<p>Second, you can manually add a cookie to the Cookie Manager.  However, if you do this,
the cookie will be shared by all JMeter threads.</p>
<p>Note that such Cookies are created with an Expiration time far in the future</p>
<p>
Since version 2.0.3, cookies with null values are ignored by default.
This can be changed by setting the JMeter property: CookieManager.delete_null_cookies=false.
Note that this also applies to manually defined cookies - any such cookies will be removed from the display when it is updated.
Note also that the cookie name must be unique - if a second cookie is defined with the same name, it will replace the first.

<description><p>This element lets you set default values that your HTTP Request controllers use.  For example, if you are

you add the 25 HTTP Request controllers, leave the "Server Name or IP" field empty.  The controllers will inherit
this field value from the HTTP Request Defaults element.</p>
<note>
In JMeter 2.2 and earlier, port 80 was treated specially - it was ignored if the sampler used the https protocol.
JMeter 2.3 and later treat all port values equally; a sampler that does not specify a port will use the HTTP Request Defaults port, if one is provided.

<note>
Note: radio buttons only have two states - on or off.
This makes it impossible to override settings consistently
- does off mean off, or does it mean use the current default?
JMeter uses the latter (otherwise defaults would not work at all).
So if the button is off, then a later element can set it on,
but if the button is on, a later element cannot set it off.

Versions of JMeter up to 2.3.2 supported only one Header Manager per sampler;

</p>
<p>
<b>JMeter now supports multiple Header Managers</b>. The header entries are merged to form the list for the sampler.
If an entry to be merged matches an existing header name, it replaces the previous entry,
unless the entry value is empty, in which case any existing entry is removed.
This allows one to set up a default set of headers, and apply adjustments to particular samplers.

<component name="User Defined Variables" index="&sect-num;.4.14"  width="741" height="266" screenshot="user_defined_variables.png">
<description><p>The User Defined Variables element lets you define an <b>initial set of variables</b>, just as in the <complink name="Test Plan" />.
<b>
Note that all the UDV elements in a test plan - no matter where they are - are processed at the start.
</b>
So you cannot reference variables which are defined as part of a test run, e.g. in a Post-Processor.
</p>
<p>
<b>
UDVs should not be used with functions that generate different results each time they are called.
Only the result of the first function call will be saved in the variable. 
</b>
However, UDVs can be used with functions such as __P(), for example:
<pre>
HOST      ${__P(host,localhost)} 
</pre>
which would define the variable "HOST" to have the value of the JMeter property "host", defaulting to "localhost" if not defined.
</p>
<p>
For defining variables during a test run, see <complink name="User Parameters"/>.
UDVs are processed in the order they appear in the Plan, from top to bottom.
</p>
<p>
For simplicity, it is suggested that UDVs are placed only at the start of a Thread Group
(or perhaps under the Test Plan itself).
</p>
<p>
Once the Test Plan and all UDVs have been processed, the resulting set of variables is
copied to each thread to provide the initial set of variables.
</p>
<p>
If a runtime element such as a User Parameters Pre-Processor or Regular Expression Extractor defines a variable
with the same name as one of the UDV variables, then this will replace the initial value, and all other test
elements in the thread will see the updated value.
</p>
</description>
<note>
If you have more than one Thread Group, make sure you use different names for different values, as UDVs are shared between Thread Groups.
Also, the variables are not available for use until after the element has been processed, 
so you cannot reference variables that are defined in the same element.
You can reference variables defined in earlier UDVs or on the Test Plan.

<description>
<p>
The Random Variable Config Element is used to generate random numeric strings and store them in variable for use later.
It's simpler than using <complink name="User Defined Variables"/> together with the __Random() function.

<p>
The output variable is constructed by using the random number generator,
and then the resulting number is formatted using the format string.
The number is calculated using the formula <code>minimum+Random.nextInt(maximum-minimum+1)</code>.
Random.nextInt() requires a positive integer.
This means that maximum-minimum - i.e. the range - must be less than 2147483647,
however the minimum and maximum values can be any long values so long as the range is OK.

<section name="&sect-num;.5 Assertions" anchor="assertions">
<description>
	<p>
	Assertions are used to perform additional checks on samplers, and are processed after <b>every sampler</b>
	in the same scope.
	To ensure that an Assertion is applied only to a particular sampler, add it as a child of the sampler.
	</p>
    <p>
    Note: Unless documented otherwise, Assertions are not applied to sub-samples (child samples) -
    only to the parent sample.
    In the case of BSF and BeanShell Assertions, the script can retrieve sub-samples using the method
    <code>prev.getSubResults()</code> which returns an array of SampleResults.
    The array will be empty if there are none.
    </p>
    <p>
    Versions of JMeter after 2.3.2 include the option to apply certain assertions
    to either the main sample, the sub-samples or both. 
    The default is to apply the assertion to the main sample only.
    If the Assertion supports this option, then there will be an entry on the GUI which looks like the following:
    <figure width="533" height="55" image="assertion/assertionscope.png">Assertion Scope</figure>
    or the following
    <figure width="756" height="55" image="assertion/assertionscopevar.png">Assertion Scope</figure>
    If a sub-sampler fails and the main sample is successful,
    then the main sample will be set to failed status and an Assertion Result will be added.
    If the JMeter variable option is used, it is assumed to relate to the main sample, and
    any failure will be applied to the main sample only.
    </p>
	<note>
	The variable <b>JMeterThread.last_sample_ok</b> is updated to
	"true" or "false" after all assertions for a sampler have been run.

<component name="Response Assertion" index="&sect-num;.5.1" anchor="basic_assertion"  width="921" height="423" screenshot="assertion/assertion.png">

<description><p>The response assertion control panel lets you add pattern strings to be compared against various
	fields of the response.
	The pattern strings are:
	<ul>
	<li>Contains, Matches: Perl5-style regular expressions</li>
	<li>Equals, Substring: plain text, case-sensitive</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
	A summary of the pattern matching characters can be found at <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/oro/api/org/apache/oro/text/regex/package-summary.html">ORO Perl5 regular expressions.</a>
	</p>
	<p>You can also choose whether the strings will be expected
to <b>match</b> the entire response, or if the response is only expected to <b>contain</b> the
pattern. You can attach multiple assertions to any controller for additional flexibility.</p>
<p>Note that the pattern string should not include the enclosing delimiters, 
	i.e. use <b>Price: \d+</b> not <b>/Price: \d+/</b>.
	</p>
	<p>
	By default, the pattern is in multi-line mode, which means that the "." meta-character does not match newline.
    In multi-line mode, "^" and "$" match the start or end of any line anywhere within the string 
    - not just the start and end of the entire string. Note that \s does match new-line.
	Case is also significant. To override these settings, one can use the <i>extended regular expression</i> syntax.
	For example:
</p>
<pre>
	(?i) - ignore case
	(?s) - treat target as single line, i.e. "." matches new-line
	(?is) - both the above
    These can be used anywhere within the expression and remain in effect until overriden.  e.g.
    (?i)apple(?-i) Pie - matches "ApPLe Pie", but not "ApPLe pIe"
    (?s)Apple.+?Pie - matches Apple followed by Pie, which may be on a subsequent line.
    Apple(?s).+?Pie - same as above, but it's probably clearer to use the (?s) at the start.

                The overall success of the sample is determined by combining the result of the
                assertion with the existing Response status.
                When the Ignore Status checkbox is selected, the Response status is forced
                to successful before evaluating the Assertion.
                </p>
                HTTP Responses with statuses in the 4xx and 5xx ranges are normally
                regarded as unsuccessful. 
                The "Ignore status" checkbox can be used to set the status successful before performing further checks.
                Note that this will have the effect of clearing any previous assertion failures,

        There is no difference between setting up
        one Assertion with multiple patterns and setting up multiple Assertions with one
        pattern each (assuming the other options are the same).
        <b>However, when the Ignore Status checkbox is selected, this has the effect of cancelling any

</p><p>
Note that a different Interpreter is used for each independent occurence of the assertion
in each thread in a test script, but the same Interpreter is used for subsequent invocations.
This means that variables persist across calls to the assertion.
</p>
<p>
All Assertions are called from the same thread as the sampler.
</p>
<p>
If the property "beanshell.assertion.init" is defined, it is passed to the Interpreter
as the name of a sourced file. This can be used to define common methods and variables.
There is a sample init file in the bin directory: BeanShellAssertion.bshrc
</p>
<p>
The test element supports the ThreadListener and TestListener methods.
These should be defined in the initialisation file.

<component name="HTML Link Parser" index="&sect-num;.7.1" width="239" height="113" screenshot="html_link_parser.png" anchor="html_link_parser">
<description>
<p>This modifier parses HTML response from the server and extracts
links and forms.  A URL test sample that passes through this modifier will be examined to
see if it &quot;matches&quot; any of the links or forms extracted
from the immediately previous response.  It would then replace the values in the URL
test sample with appropriate values from the matching link or form.  Perl-type regular
expressions are used to find matches.</p>
</description>
<note>
Matches are performed using protocol, host, path and parameter names.
The target sampler cannot contain parameters that are not in the response links.
</note>
<example title="Spidering Example" anchor="spider_example">
<p>Consider a simple example: let's say you wanted JMeter to &quot;spider&quot; through your site,
hitting link after link parsed from the HTML returned from your server (this is not
actually the most useful thing to do, but it serves as a good example).  You would create
a <complink name="Simple Controller"/>, and add the &quot;HTML Link Parser&quot; to it.  Then, create an
HTTP Request, and set the domain to &quot;.*&quot;, and the path likewise. This will
cause your test sample to match with any link found on the returned pages.  If you wanted to
restrict the spidering to a particular domain, then change the domain value
to the one you want.  Then, only links to that domain will be followed.
</p>
</example>

<example title="Poll Example" anchor="poll_example">
<p>A more useful example: given a web polling application, you might have a page with
several poll options as radio buttons for the user to select.  Let's say the values
of the poll options are very dynamic - maybe user generated.  If you wanted JMeter to
test the poll, you could either create test samples with hardcoded values chosen, or you
could let the HTML Link Parser parse the form, and insert a random poll option into
your URL test sample.  To do this, follow the above example, except, when configuring
your Web Test controller's URL options, be sure to choose &quot;POST&quot; as the
method.  Put in hard-coded values for the domain, path, and any additional form parameters.
Then, for the actual radio button parameter, put in the name (let's say it's called &quot;poll_choice&quot;),
and then &quot;.*&quot; for the value of that parameter.  When the modifier examines
this URL test sample, it will find that it &quot;matches&quot; the poll form (and
it shouldn't match any other form, given that you've specified all the other aspects of
the URL test sample), and it will replace your form parameters with the matching
parameters from the form.  Since the regular expression &quot;.*&quot; will match with
anything, the modifier will probably have a list of radio buttons to choose from.  It
will choose at random, and replace the value in your URL test sample.  Each time through
the test, a new random value will be chosen.</p>

<figure width="755" height="325" image="modification.png">Figure 18 - Online Poll Example</figure>

<note>One important thing to remember is that you must create a test sample immediately
prior that will return an HTML page with the links and forms that are relevant to
your dynamic test sample.</note>

<description><p>This modifier works similarly to the HTML Link Parser, except it has a specific purpose for which
it is easier to use than the HTML Link Parser, and more efficient.  For web applications that

ThreadGroup level, much like the <complink name="HTTP Cookie Manager"/>.  Simply give it the name
of the session id parameter, and it will find it on the page and add the argument to every
request of that ThreadGroup.</p>
<p>Alternatively, this modifier can be attached to select requests and it will modify only them.

	<description>
	<p>
		As the name suggests, Post-Processors are applied after samplers. Note that they are
		applied to <b>all</b> the samplers in the same scope, so to ensure that a post-processor
		is applied only to a particular sampler, add it as a child of the sampler.
	</p>
	<p>
	Note: Unless documented otherwise, Post-Processors are not applied to sub-samples (child samples) -
	only to the parent sample.
	In the case of BSF and BeanShell post-processors, the script can retrieve sub-samples using the method
	<code>prev.getSubResults()</code> which returns an array of SampleResults.
	The array will be empty if there are none.
	</p>
	<p>
	Post-Processors are run before Assertions, so they do not have access to any Assertion Results, nor will
	the sample status reflect the results of any Assertions. If you require access to Assertion Results, try
	using a Listener instead. Also note that the variable JMeterThread.last_sample_ok is set to "true" or "false"
	after all Assertions have been run.

        <li>Body - the body of the response, e.g. the content of a web-page (excluding headers)</li>
        <li>Body (unescaped) - the body of the response, with all Html escape codes replaced.
        Note that Html escapes are processed without regard to context, so some incorrect substitutions
        may be made.
        <note>Note that this option highly impacts performances, so use it only when absolutely necessary and be aware of its impacts</note>
        </li>
        <li>Body as a Document - the extract text from various type of documents via Apache Tika (see <complink name="View Results Tree"/> Document view section).

        Headers can be useful for HTTP samples; it may not be present for other sample types.
        </property>
        <property name="Reference Name" required="Yes">The name of the JMeter variable in which to store the result.  Also note that each group is stored as [refname]_g#, where [refname] is the string you entered as the reference name, and # is the group number, where group 0 is the entire match, group 1 is the match from the first set of parentheses, etc.</property>
        <property name="Regular Expression" required="Yes">The regular expression used to parse the response data. 
        This must contain at least one set of parentheses "()" to capture a portion of the string, unless using the group $0$.
        Do not enclose the expression in / / - unless of course you want to match these characters as well.
        </property>
        <property name="Template" required="Yes">The template used to create a string from the matches found.  This is an arbitrary string
        with special elements to refer to groups within the regular expression.  The syntax to refer to a group is: '$1$' to refer to
        group 1, '$2$' to refer to group 2, etc. $0$ refers to whatever the entire expression matches.</property>
        <property name="Match No." required="Yes">Indicates which match to use.  The regular expression may match multiple times.

        <property name="Default Value" required="No, but recommended">
        If the regular expression does not match, then the reference variable will be set to the default value.
        This is particularly useful for debugging tests. If no default is provided, then it is difficult to tell
        whether the regular expression did not match, or the RE element was not processed or maybe the wrong variable
        is being used.
        <p>
        However, if you have several test elements that set the same variable, 
        you may wish to leave the variable unchanged if the expression does not match.
        In this case, remove the default value once debugging is complete.
        </p>

<p>
	If the match number is set to a non-negative number, and a match occurs, the variables are set as follows:
	<ul>
		<li>refName - the value of the template</li>
		<li>refName_gn, where n=0,1,2 - the groups for the match</li>
		<li>refName_g - the number of groups in the Regex (excluding 0)</li>
	</ul>
	If no match occurs, then the refName variable is set to the default (unless this is absent). 
	Also, the following variables are removed:
	<ul>
		<li>refName_g0</li>
		<li>refName_g1</li>
		<li>refName_g</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	If the match number is set to a negative number, then all the possible matches in the sampler data are processed.
	The variables are set as follows:
	<ul>
		<li>refName_matchNr - the number of matches found; could be 0</li>
		<li>refName_n, where n = 1,2,3 etc - the strings as generated by the template</li>
		<li>refName_n_gm, where m=0,1,2 - the groups for match n</li>
		<li>refName - always set to the default value</li>
		<li>refName_gn - not set</li>

<component name="Test Plan" index="&sect-num;.9.1"  width="560" height="457" screenshot="testplan.png">
<description>
<p>
The Test Plan is where the overall settings for a test are specified.
</p>
<p>
Static variables can be defined for values that are repeated throughout a test, such as server names.
For example the variable SERVER could be defined as www.example.com, and the rest of the test plan
could refer to it as ${SERVER}. This simplifies changing the name later.
</p>
<p>
If the same variable name is reused on one of more
<complink name="User Defined Variables"/> Configuration elements,
the value is set to the last definition in the test plan (reading from top to bottom).
Such variables should be used for items that may change between test runs, 
but which remain the same during a test run.
</p>
<p>
<b>Note that the Test Plan cannot refer to variables it defines.</b> 
If you need to construct other variables from the Test Plan variables, 
use a <complink name="User Defined Variables"/> test element.
</p>
<p>
Selecting Functional Testing instructs JMeter to save the  additional sample information
- Response Data and Sampler Data - to all result files.
This increases the resources needed to run a test, and may adversely impact JMeter performance.
If more data is required for a particular sampler only, then add a Listener to it, and configure the fields as required.
[The option does not affect CSV result files, which cannot currently store such information.]
</p>
<p>Also, an option exists here to instruct JMeter to run the <complink name="Thread Group"/> serially rather than in parallel.</p>
<p>Run tearDown Thread Groups after shutdown of main threads: 
if selected, the tearDown groups (if any) will be run after graceful shutdown of the main threads.
The tearDown threads won't be run if the test is forcibly stopped.
</p>
<p>
Test plan now provides an easy way to add classpath setting to a specific test plan. 
The feature is additive, meaning that you can add jar files or directories, but removing an entry requires restarting JMeter.
Note that this cannot be used to add JMeter GUI plugins, because they are processed earlier.
However it can be useful for utility jars such as JDBC drivers. 
</p>
<p>
JMeter properties also provides an entry for loading additional classpaths.
In jmeter.properties, edit "user.classpath" to include additional libraries.

<component name="Thread Group" index="&sect-num;.9.2"  width="583" height="447" screenshot="threadgroup.png">
<description>
<p>A Thread Group defines a pool of users that will execute a particular test case against your server.  In the Thread Group GUI, you can control the number of users simulated (num of threads), the ramp up time (how long it takes to start all the threads), the number of times to perform the test, and optionally, a start and stop time for the test.</p>
<p>
See also <complink name="tearDown Thread Group"/> and <complink name="setUp Thread Group"/>.
</p>
<p>
When using the scheduler, JMeter runs the thread group until either the number of loops is reached or the duration/end-time is reached - whichever occurs first.
Note that the condition is only checked between samples; when the end condition is reached, that thread will stop.
JMeter does not interrupt samplers which are waiting for a response, so the end time may be delayed arbitrarily.

        <li>Start Next Loop - ignore the error, start next loop and continue with the test</li>
        <li>Stop Thread - current thread exits</li>
        <li>Stop Test - the entire test is stopped at the end of any current samples.</li>

<component name="WorkBench" index="&sect-num;.9.3"  width="232" height="68" screenshot="workbench.png">
<description>
<p>The WorkBench simply provides a place to temporarily store test elements while not in use, for copy/paste purposes, or any other purpose you desire. 
When you save your test plan, WorkBench items are not saved with it. 
Your WorkBench can be saved independently, if you like (right-click on WorkBench and choose Save).</p>
<p>Certain test elements are only available on the WorkBench:</p>

<component name="SSL Manager" index="&sect-num;.9.4" screenshot="">
<p>
  The SSL Manager is a way to select a client certificate so that you can test
  applications that use Public Key Infrastructure (PKI).
  It is only needed if you have not set up the appropriate System properties.
</p>

<b>Choosing a Client Certificate</b>
<p>
  You may either use a Java Key Store (JKS) format key store, or a Public Key
  Certificate Standard #12 (PKCS12) file for your client certificates.  There
  is a feature of the JSSE libraries that require you to have at least a six character
  password on your key (at least for the keytool utility that comes with your
  JDK).
</p>
<p>
  To select the client certificate, choose Options-&gt;SSL Manager from the menu bar.
  You will be presented with a file finder that looks for PKCS12 files by default.
  Your PKCS12 file must have the extension '.p12' for SSL Manager to recognize it
  as a PKCS12 file.  Any other file will be treated like an average JKS key store.
  If JSSE is correctly installed, you will be prompted for the password.  The text
  box does not hide the characters you type at this point--so make sure no one is
  looking over your shoulder.  The current implementation assumes that the password
  for the keystore is also the password for the private key of the client you want
  to authenticate as.
</p>
<p>Or you can set the appropriate System properties - see the system.properties file.</p>
<p>
  The next time you run your test, the SSL Manager will examine your key store to
  see if it has at least one key available to it.  If there is only one key, SSL
  Manager will select it for you.  If there is more than one key, it currently selects the first key.
  There is currently no way to select other entries in the keystore, so the desired key must be the first.
</p>
<b>Things to Look Out For</b>
<p>
  You must have your Certificate Authority (CA) certificate installed properly
  if it is not signed by one of the five CA certificates that ships with your
  JDK.  One method to install it is to import your CA certificate into a JKS
  file, and name the JKS file "jssecacerts".  Place the file in your JRE's
  lib/security folder.  This file will be read before the "cacerts" file in
  the same directory.  Keep in mind that as long as the "jssecacerts" file
  exists, the certificates installed in "cacerts" will not be used.  This may
  cause problems for you.  If you don't mind importing your CA certificate into
  the "cacerts" file, then you can authenticate against all of the CA certificates
  installed.
</p>

<component name="HTTP Proxy Server" index="&sect-num;.9.5"  width="957" height="593" screenshot="proxy_control.png">
<description><p>The Proxy Server allows JMeter to watch and record your actions while you browse your web application
with your normal browser.  JMeter will create test sample objects and store them
directly into your test plan as you go (so you can view samples interactively while you make them).</p>

<p>To use the proxy server, <i>add</i> the HTTP Proxy Server element to the workbench.
Select the WorkBench element in the tree, and right-click on this element to get the
Add menu (Add --> Non-Test Elements --> HTTP Proxy Server).</p>
<p>
You also need to set up your browser to use the JMeter proxy port as the proxy for HTTP and HTTPS requests.
Do not use JMeter as the proxy for any other request types - FTP, etc. - as the JMeter proxy cannot handle them.
</p>
<p>
When recording HTTPS, the JMeter proxy server uses a dummy certificate to enable it to accept the SSL connection from
the browser. This certificate is not one of the certificates that browsers normally trust, and will not be for the
correct host, so the browser should display a dialogue asking if you want to accept the certificate or not. For example:
<code>
1) The server's name "www.example.com" does not match the certificate's name
   "JMeter Proxy". Somebody may be trying to eavesdrop on you.
2) The certificate for "JMeter Proxy" is signed by the unknown Certificate Authority
   "JMeter Proxy". It is not possible to verify that this is a valid certificate.
</code> 
You will need to accept the certificate in order to allow the JMeter Proxy to intercept the SSL traffic in order to
record it. You should only accept the certificate temporarily.
</p>
<p>
The following properties can be used to change the certificate that is used:
<ul>
<li>proxy.cert.directory - the directory in which to find the certificate (default = JMeter bin/)</li>
<li>proxy.cert.file - name of the keystore file (default "proxyserver.jks")</li>
<li>proxy.cert.keystorepass - keystore password (default "password")</li>
<li>proxy.cert.keypassword - certificate key password (default "password")</li>
<li>proxy.cert.type - the certificate type (default "JKS")</li>
<li>proxy.cert.factory - the factory (default "SunX509")</li>
<li>proxy.ssl.protocol - the protocol to be used (default "SSLv3")</li>
</ul>
</p>
<note>
If your browser currently uses a proxy (e.g. a company intranet may route all external requests via a proxy),
then you need to <a href="get-started.html#proxy_server">tell JMeter to use that proxy</a> before starting JMeter, 
using the <a href="get-started.html#options">command-line options</a> -H and -P.
This setting will also be needed when running the generated test plan.
</note>

<properties>
        <property name="Name" required="No">Descriptive name for this element that is shown in the tree.</property>
        <property name="Port" required="Yes">The port that the Proxy Server listens to.  8080 is the default, but you can change it.</property>
        <property name="Target Controller" required="Yes">The controller where the proxy will store the generated samples. By default, it will look for a Recording Controller and store them there wherever it is.</property>
        <property name="Grouping" required="Yes">Whether to group samplers for requests from a single "click" (requests received without significant time separation), and how to represent that grouping in the recording:
           <ul>
             <li>Do not group samplers: store all recorded samplers sequentially, without any grouping.</li>
             <li>Add separators between groups: add a controller named "--------------" to create a visual separation between the groups. Otherwise the samplers are all stored sequentially.</li>
             <li>Put each group in a new controller: create a new <complink name="Simple Controller"/> for each group, and store all samplers for that group in it.</li>
             <li>Store 1st sampler of each group only: only the first request in each group will be recorded. The "Follow Redirects" and "Retrieve All Embedded Resources..." flags will be turned on in those samplers.</li>
             <li>Put each group in a new transaction controller: create a new <complink name="Transaction Controller"/> for each group, and store all samplers for that group in it.</li>
           </ul>
           The property <b>proxy.pause</b> determines the minimum gap that JMeter needs between requests
           to treat them as separate "clicks". The default is 1000 (milliseconds) i.e. 1 second.
           If you are using grouping, please ensure that you leave the required gap between clicks.
        </property>
        <!-- TODO:property name="Group Separation Interval">Inactivity time between two requests needed to consider them in two separate groups.</property-->
		<property name="Capture HTTP Headers" required="Yes">Should headers be added to the plan?
		If specified, a Header Manager will be added to each HTTP Sampler.
		The Proxy server always removes Cookie and Authorization headers from the generated Header Managers.
		By default it also removes If-Modified-Since and If-None-Match headers.
		These are used to determine if the browser cache items are up to date;
		when recording one normally wants to download all the content.
        To change which additional headers are removed, define the JMeter property <b>proxy.headers.remove</b>
        as a comma-separated list of headers.
        </property>
		<property name="Add Assertions" required="Yes">Add a blank assertion to each sampler?</property>
		<property name="Regex Matching" required="Yes">Use Regex Matching when replacing variables? If checked replacement will use word boundaries, ie it will only replace word matching values of variable, not part of a word. A word boundary follows Perl5 definition and is equivalent to \b.</property>
        <property name="Type" required="Yes">Which type of sampler to generate (the Java default or HTTPClient)</property>
        <property name="Redirect Automatically" required="Yes">Set Redirect Automatically in the generated samplers?</property>
        <property name="Follow Redirects" required="Yes">Set Follow Redirects in the generated samplers?</property>
		<property name="Use Keep-Alive" required="Yes">Set Use Keep-Alive in the generated samplers?</property>
		<property name="Retrieve all Embedded Resources" required="Yes">Set Retrieve all Embedded Resources in the generated samplers?</property>
		<property name="Content Type filter" required="No">
		Filter the requests based on the content-type - e.g. "text/html [;charset=utf-8 ]".
		The fields are regular expressions which are checked to see if they are contained in the content-type.
		[Does not have to match the entire field].
		The include filter is checked first, then the exclude filter.
		Samples which are filtered out will not be stored.
		</property>
        <property name="Patterns to Include" required="No">Regular expressions that are matched against the full URL that is sampled.  Allows filtering of requests that are recorded.  All requests pass through, but only
        those that meet the requirements of the Include/Exclude fields are <i>recorded</i>.  If both Include and Exclude are
        left empty, then everything is recorded (which can result in dozens of samples recorded for each page, as images, stylesheets,
        etc are recorded).  <b>If there is at least one entry in the Include field, then only requests that match one or more Include patterns are
        recorded</b>.</property>
        <property name="Patterns to Exclude" required="No">Regular expressions that are matched against the URL that is sampled.
        <b>Any requests that match one or more Exclude pattern are <i>not</i> recorded</b>.</property>
        <property name="Start Button" required="N/A">Start the proxy server.  JMeter writes the following message to the console once the proxy server has started up and is ready to take requests: "Proxy up and running!".</property>
        <property name="Stop Button" required="N/A">Stop the proxy server.</property>
        <property name="Restart Button" required="N/A">Stops and restarts the proxy server.  This is
  useful when you change/add/delete an include/exclude filter expression.</property>
</properties>

<p>The <b>include and exclude patterns</b> are treated as regular expressions (using Jakarta ORO).
They will be matched against the host name, port (actual or implied) path and query (if any) of each browser request.
If the URL you are browsing is <br></br> 
<b>&quot;http://jmeter.apache.org/jmeter/index.html?username=xxxx&quot;</b>,<br></br> 
then the regular expression will be tested against the string:<br></br> 
<b>&quot;jmeter.apache.org:80/jmeter/index.html?username=xxxx&quot;</b>.<br></br>   
Thus, if you want to include all .html files, your regular expression might look like: <br></br> 
<b>&quot;.*\.html(\?.*)?&quot;</b> - or <b>&quot;.*\.html&quot;</b> 
if you know that there is no query string or you only want html pages without query strings.
</p>
<p>
If there are any include patterns, then the URL <b>must match at least one</b> of the patterns
, otherwise it will not be recorded.
If there are any exclude patterns, then the URL <b>must not match any</b> of the patterns
, otherwise it will not be recorded.
Using a combination of includes and excludes,
you should be able to record what you are interested in and skip what you are not.
</p>

<p>
N.B. the string that is matched by the regular expression must be the same as the <b>whole</b> host+path string.<br></br>Thus <b>&quot;\.html&quot;</b> will <b>not</b> match <b>j.a.o/index.html</b>
</p>

<p>
Versions of JMeter from 2.3.2 are able to capture binary POST data.
To configure which content-types are treated as binary, update the JMeter property proxy.binary.types.
The default settings are as follows:
<pre>
# These content-types will be handled by saving the request in a file:
proxy.binary.types=application/x-amf,application/x-java-serialized-object
# The files will be saved in this directory:
proxy.binary.directory=user.dir
# The files will be created with this file filesuffix:
proxy.binary.filesuffix=.binary
</pre>
</p>

<p>It is also possible to have the proxy add timers to the recorded script. To
do this, create a timer directly within the HTTP Proxy Server component.
The proxy will place a copy of this timer into each sample it records, or into
the first sample of each group if you're using grouping. This copy will then be
scanned for occurences of variable ${T} in its properties, and any such
occurences will be replaced by the time gap from the previous sampler
recorded (in milliseconds).</p>

<p>When you are ready to begin, hit &quot;start&quot;.</p>
<note>You will need to edit the proxy settings of your browser to point at the
appropriate server and port, where the server is the machine JMeter is running on, and
the port # is from the Proxy Control Panel shown above.</note>

<p><b>Where Do Samples Get Recorded?</b></p>
<p>JMeter places the recorded samples in the Target Controller you choose. If you choose the default option
"Use Recording Controller", they will be stored in the first Recording Controller found in the test object tree (so be
sure to add a Recording Controller before you start recording).</p>

<p>
If the Proxy does not seem to record any samples, this could be because the browser is not actually using the proxy.
To check if this is the case, try stopping the proxy.
If the browser still downloads pages, then it was not sending requests via the proxy.
Double-check the browser options. 
If you are trying to record from a server running on the same host,
then check that the browser is not set to "Bypass proxy server for local addresses"
(this example is from IE7, but there will be similar options for other browsers).
If JMeter does not record browser URLs such as http://localhost/ or http://127.0.0.1/,
try using the non-loopback hostname or IP address, e.g. http://myhost/ or http://192.168.0.2/.
</p>

<p><b>Handling of HTTP Request Defaults</b></p>
<p>If the HTTP Proxy Server finds enabled <complink name="HTTP Request Defaults"/> directly within the
controller where samples are being stored, or directly within any of its parent controllers, the recorded samples
will have empty fields for the default values you specified. You may further control this behaviour by placing an
HTTP Request Defaults element directly within the HTTP Proxy Server, whose non-blank values will override
those in the other HTTP Request Defaults. See <a href="best-practices.html#proxy_server"> Best
Practices with the Proxy Server</a> for more info.</p>

<p><b>User Defined Variable replacement</b></p>
<p>Similarly, if the HTTP Proxy Server finds <complink name="User Defined Variables"/> (UDV) directly within the
controller where samples are being stored, or directly within any of its parent controllers, the recorded samples
will have any occurences of the values of those variables replaced by the corresponding variable. Again, you can
place User Defined Variables directly within the HTTP Proxy Server to override the values to be replaced. See
<a href="best-practices.html#proxy_server"> Best Practices with the Proxy Server</a> for more info.</p>

<note>Please note that matching is case-sensitive.</note>

<p>Replacement by Variables: by default, the Proxy server looks for all occurences of UDV values. 
If you define the variable "WEB" with the value "www", for example, 
the string "www" will be replaced by ${WEB} wherever it is found.
To avoid this happening everywhere, set the "Regex Matching" check-box.
This tells the proxy server to treat values as Regexes (using ORO).
<br></br>
If you want to match a whole string only, enclose it in ^$, e.g. "^thus$".
<br></br>
If you want to match /images at the start of a string only, use the value "^/images".
Jakarta ORO also supports zero-width look-ahead, so one can match /images/... 
but retain the trailing / in the output by using "^/images(?=/)".
Note that the current version of Jakara ORO does not support look-behind - i.e. "(?&amp;lt;=...) or (?&amp;lt;!...)".
<br></br>
If there are any problems interpreting any variables as patterns, these are reported in jmeter.log,
so be sure to check this if UDVs are not working as expected.
</p>
<p>When you are done recording your test samples, stop the proxy server (hit the &quot;stop&quot; button).  Remember to reset
your browser's proxy settings.  Now, you may want to sort and re-order the test script, add timers, listeners, a
cookie manager, etc.</p>

<p><b>How can I record the server's responses too?</b></p>
<p>Just place a <complink name="View Results Tree"/> listener as a child of the Proxy Server and the responses will be displayed. 
You can also add a <complink name="Save Responses to a file"/> Post-Processor which will save the responses to files.
</p>

<p><b>Cookie Manager</b></p>
<p>
If the server you are testing against uses cookies, remember to add an <complink name="HTTP Cookie Manager"/> to the test plan
when you have finished recording it.
During recording, the browser handles any cookies, but JMeter needs a Cookie Manager
to do the cookie handling during a test run.
The JMeter Proxy server passes on all cookies sent by the browser during recording, but does not save them to the test
plan because they are likely to change between runs.
</p>
<p><b>Authorization Manager</b></p>
<p>
The Proxy server passes on any Authorization headers sent by the browser, but does not save them in the test plan.
If the site requires Authorization, you will need to add an Authorization Manager and fill it in with the necessary entries.
</p>
<p><b>Uploading files</b></p>
<p>
Some browsers (e.g. Firefox and Opera) don't include the full name of a file when uploading files.
This can cause the JMeter proxy server to fail.
One solution is to ensure that any files to be uploaded are in the JMeter working directory,
either by copying the files there or by starting JMeter in the directory containing the files.
</p>
<p><b>Recording HTTP Based Non Textual Protocols not natively available in JMeter</b></p>
<p>
You may have to record an HTTP protocol that is not handled by default by JMeter (Custom Binary Protocol, Adobe Flex, Microsoft Silverlight... ).
Although JMeter does not provide a native proxy implementation to record these protocols, you have the ability to
record these protocols by implementing a custom SamplerCreator. This Sampler Creator will translate the binary format into a HTTPSamplerBase subclass
that can be added to the JMeter Test Case.
For more details see "Extending JMeter".
